    "text": "Now is the time for other countries to start sanctioning ICE agents. Because there is a lot of good work nationally and internationally on identifying, labeling, and publishing who ICE agents are. But naming and shaming can only go so far when the US State Department is hiring neo-nazis that used to cover their faces. And the only way naming and shaming as a technique will be effective is if it is given teeth by other state-level actors. And so if you are an activist internationally and you want a demand from your state, it's not just a general strike against America. That's great. But it is specifically and effectively sanctioning the individuals that are ICE agents. Sanchoning their businesses, their families' businesses. Sanchoning their travel, their ability for their money to be in that country, their trade partners money to be in that country. Because once you start hitting the bottom line of a global economy for these individuals, it will actually be felt. Because America knows as long as the empire can keep pulling in the imperial money into America and oppressing its own people with that, it will be effective. But if we can start mobilizing things outside of America as well as America does, we can be successful. So if you want to be taken seriously as an anti-Trump country, as a person that actually stands against this type of fascism, it's not good enough to just have snide remarks. You gotta start sanctioning the fucking foot soldiers, guys.",

Like you, you want women to be stupid because because here's you speaking at turning point USA's amfest, the same organization that hosted a women's conference, promoting being a tradwife and explicitly said women should only go to college to get an MRS degree. You work at Blaze TV, a thing that actively promotes women not being in careers and importantly that they should give up education or career growth for their family, whereas husbands shouldn't. This is such a disgusting thing to say from you when you pretend. Should it be smart and think your way through politics? No, you don't. You're an evangelical fundamentalist who believes women shouldn't get an equal education and shouldn't have an equal career. But you do get half right the reason that people like you believe this. That behooves them. It's in their interests for women to be as stupid as possible. Wrong usage of behoove, but that's true. It is in people like your interests, like people who don't want women to be intelligent, to have dumb women because you are trying to convince them to do things that are demonstrably not in their interest to feed the machine of ethno-nationalist capitalism. And now you are seeing the nasty consequences and nasty sides of that movement going after you and people you support. Isn't that something?",

I don't think the American Empire can make any one illegal on-stroll in land, but that's not what a lot of libs mean when they say it, even if they do capitulate to saying it from the current pressure that's happening. What they mean is taking the thing that ice is, which is a terrorist organization meant to enforce arbitrary and racial laws, and just making a different terrorist organization with a different name. And if we want radical, effective change from this real, radical, revolutionary moment, we need to be very precise, which is that we must abolish all conceptions that underpinned ice. The hyper militarized society that America is and has become, the hyper racialized culture and government that America has always been, that enables an ethnic cleansing by one and many of our government agencies, and then the newer and developed phenomenon of funneling that racism into anti-immigration sentiment through the mass militarization of our border. All of those and many more precepts that justify and led to the large upscale of terrorism by ice must be abolished and destroyed well before we can even succeed in merely renaming.",

I asked go on with your serious critique of a political and economic theory. She farted while I was eating it guy. I think communism is like an idea a seven year old would bring up like once you tell them that homeless people exist. I think the only way you understand it as that is if you've never read any communist theory ever and your understanding of communism is USSR bad. It mad because you know being a communist is like cool nowadays or whatever. So we're strongly in red scare territory where you're never actually going to name what you're talking about with communism. But you're going to kind of vaguely wave to country bad, but ignore like the billions that were raised out of poverty and starvation and slavery by that ideological system. Forget that. But go on. But basically they're pressing me and I'm like, oh well, it doesn't work. And they're like, that's because no one ever allowed it to work. And I'm like, what do you mean? That's my man. They're capitalist countries who were sanctioned to name them. Name them. Name the capitalist country that America went in committed genocide slaughtered and cood. Because that's what we did in Indonesia, Brazil, Chile, Peru. Name them. Capitalist countries who survived global depressions world wars. I just feel like it's oh yes, like how like how the USSR one world were two like how they did that. Like they were the primary reason that the Nazis lost like how they did that. Okay, okay, go on. Yeah, yeah. Okay, I see what we're working with my friend. You're never going to make a substantive argument about how it actually worked because we've also seen that capitalism fails. When millions are murdered by capitalist, that's capitalism failing. When millions store or lack health care under capitalism, that's capitalism failing. But you're just doing red scare propaganda kind of comfy under a blanket because they call me so so silly. They don't know what they're talking about. Never mind that the rhetoric that I'm using literally contributed to the murder and sanction and starvation. Of millions. No, no, it's just silly. And by the way, the pride that you're having of capitalism winning, which like I'm not really contesting was literally just capitalism going and murdering all the communists. You know that, right? Like the thing you're proud of for communism not doing at E winning is murdering everyone that disagrees with you because that's what the capitalist were willing to do because it made profit. So yeah, it's equally unserious me critiquing this red scare propaganda. It's been well debunked, but I just want you to notice the repackaging of it. He's not saying anything new. He's saying it comfy and meme like and pop culture under a blanket to make a truly disgusting statement. Capitalism beat communism through slaughtering millions into something that's memeable. Exactly how prayer or you does.",

If you want a good background in Marxist analyses of history, if you've ever been frustrated by basically any online leftist and you've been like, hmm, I wonder if someone has a better idea. He does. And his lectures are freely available online and actually quite accessible, and if you don't want to listen to his lectures, his books are fantastic. I'm currently reading Blackshirts and Reds. Because understanding history and the previous struggles that have happened, and how and why they happened, is absolutely necessary if you want to be effective in actually undermining the current power structure that is, or if you've just ever been frustrated by other leftists to appear to never want to win, or rightist to appear to keep winning. No political theorist is perfect, and I don't fully endorse everything Michael Burranti says. But I do think, if especially you're beginning to want to read things or listen to things, he is a great starting point, and his work is freely available. So please go check it out at least in memoriam, because that guy made incredible contributions to American Marxist thought, and American leftism as a whole. And if we don't learn from people that have been through it, we won't win this time.",

    "text": "I go out fucking tape! You fucking, you fucking tape! You the fuck are you? Can I tell you what I see there? A really fucking scared ice agent. And that's fucking stupid. He shouldn't be scared for a series of reasons, but I say that, because it means that if he is given a reason to be scared, it won't change anything. And that is to say, scared people become violence, and he's already as scared as he can be. And you can have a different reading in that video, but I bring this up because I think we often get caught up on reminding ice agents that they're not actually in danger, that they're not actually oppressed for being ice agents. They're not actually targets of domestic terrorists. They're not many of those in the US anyway. That we forget that many of them have been trained into believing they are victims. They're white supremacists that relies on them believing that them as white people alone are consistently under threat. And the consequence of this is that if they mess with people that they should not mess with, and they do end up getting harmed in that reason, they already believe they're being oppressed. So actual real oppression won't make them feel more angry. Because if it didn't actually happen, they would have diluted it into existence in the first place. And I hear this messaging all the time when we're talking about community defense and self defense against illegal, unconstitutional federal agents kidnapping people, that somehow these terrorists are going to start being more terrorists or need a reason to do more violence, they're already diluting the reasons into existence. The choice we have is whether we defend ourselves. Or if we don't, that's the choice. Because terrorists are going to do terrorism, angry, insecure, pathetic men are going to do violence. The choice is if their fear is corresponded with reality or not. But that's a constant.",

You can't deny that they're being brutalized and with an honest eye you can't deny that the violence they face is entirely unjustified.

And my question of them is was one murder not enough? Was was was was the tens of murders that have already been reported not enough? Was the concentration camps not enough? What's changed? Because it's not the brutality. I mean, it's increasing and ratcheting up, but that was perfectly predictable. What's changed? And of course, I know what's changed. What's changed is not the violence, not the brutality. They couldn't get less of a fucking actually the system and the party they work for profit off of it. What's actually changed is the only way they think they can get away with it. The only way they think they can pretend even to wash the blood that is on their hands is now by appearing to be against it. Because previously they didn't even give a fuck to appear to be against it. Now they do. And the thing that's caused that change is the massive grassroots upswell of organizing and mobilization across America against this. And frankly, I don't think that consequence matters. I don't think the consequence of elected officials changing their minds. Mattress, they will always support the violent state. But what it does tell me is that we have the fucking people on our side. And the people can be mobilized effectively. And the democratic ruse of saying just vote harder, just elect harder is failing. So keep it fucking going. The pressure from the bottom is the only thing that works not only to prove that these elected officials are fucking useless, but to actually stand on the ground and resist this terrorist organization. And from the general strike to the rise and effective armed resistance and community defense organizations, that's the work that needs to be done. And if anyone tells you that that's too radical or that's too wild or that won't work or we just need to vote harder to tell them to go fuck themselves and ask them how they think the people we do end up electing God forbid make their decisions. Because what this just proved is that's how they do it. They are responsive. They are symptoms and they are bad fucking symptoms.",

And I don't want you to just be angry or frustrated be radicalized because then being opportunists about the extreme state violence that they helped cause is not an accident, it's their function. I distracting from, and at times condemning, the people actually on the streets effectively resisting ICE and the violence. And pushing that anger and centralizing their feckless little fucking selves in the discussion about the state violence they helped cause and still help cause, they are pushing away from effective radical action, they are funding their selves, and they are starting the cycle over of going from extremely loud, openly violent fascism to tacitly, quietly, but very effectively violent neoliberalism. And that is their fucking wet dream. So stop letting them take up all the attention, stop giving them your support for the bare minimum, and start working against all fascists, red and blue. And Democrats, if you don't want to be called fascists, get your motherfuckers in line, condemn every single motherfucker that's ever voted for ICE.

Not spend time worrying what the fascists are going to do to justify it. Not spend time worrying about every detail of the victim, or every detail of the crime, except it's a crime, accept their terrorists and start working against them as such, and hear us some basics to start. First and foremost, you need community. I live in a rural area that shit's hard to find, so here are five things you can look up to see if they're in your area. One, Socialist Party, two, Tenants Union, three, People's Core Panthers Party, five Mutual Aid Organization, or I guess six, People's Defense Organization. There are also Ice Watch Organizations Whistle Distributions. They need people like you, no matter who you are. If you're super young and have no experience but can go on the street, you're needed. If you're super old and can only show up to court, to watch proceedings as they fuck over immigrants, you're needed. If you have no money to give or all the money to give, you're needed. There is work to be done by every single person who isn't actively the people arming or shooting the working class. And importantly, simply voting, simply knocking doors, simply giving more money to Democrats or yelling at Democrats, or even debunking the fascist propaganda isn't enough, because as much as those things might have their place in a liberal democracy where they are no longer in that. We are in a fascist oligarchy very clearly. And the fact that you know deep down that not a single one of those officers, neither the ones who murdered the man today, or the ones who murdered Renee previously, are going to face justice proves that. And so you have to start acting on that. Don't just become angry, become effective.",

And the level of naivete to condemn and attack conservatives who are rejecting this obvious state terrorist murder, just like you do when you bootleg the fuck out of the cops, like you do in this video. Observe trained on first of all de-escalation tactics and yet they escalate every goddamn situation. They're in that's why they murder so many people. Second of all, everything that they do when it comes to detaining a person who is breaking the law serves a purpose. And that purpose is to inflict violence on them, especially if they are black and brown. This is infuriating. Every time we see ICE do a particularly violent act, which they are expected to do considering they are state terrorists. We get moderates coming out of the woodwork saying this is why we need cops back as if they weren't originally state terrorists. Fuck you, you're just being affected now. So yes, fuck ICE, but the answer cannot be fuck ICE because they're not cops. We don't say fuck the Taliban because they're not al-Qaeda. And if you do, you're being disrespectful to the victims of all of the state violence that came before this particular uptick in it. So yeah, fuck ICE, but if you replace them with a more palatable terrorist organization, you're not helping shit and you're actually enabling them.",

An American hegemony in particular helped provide public goods, open sea lanes, a stable financial system, collective security, and support for frameworks for resolving disputes. Let me be direct. We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition. Over the past two decades, a series of crises in finance, health, energy, and geopolitics have laid bare the risks of extreme global integration. But more recently, great powers have begun using economic integration as weapons. This is not sovereignty. It's the performance of sovereignty will accept the insubordination.",

Like for example, if you condemn countries for taking Russian money, but you recognize that without it, America would have invaded and undermined their democratic elected leader. I don't know how seriously I can take your condemnation. If you condemn them for taking money from China for infrastructure projects, but you agree that America would have used the lack of infrastructure to justify IMF loans that would have undermined the sovereignty of that country, I don't know how seriously I can take your critique. If America undermines every democracy it doesn't like, and then you look at what's left and notice they're not democracies, I don't know how well I can take your critique. Because yes, you can critique the countries that aren't America that aren't acting perfectly, but if that doesn't immediately and consistently take into account both the actual direct interventions in that country and the context of American intervention standing as a standing threat against that country if they step out of line, then I don't take you seriously. Because there's a real academic debate as to how countries act in a multipolar multivariate world. But the largest for the past 70 years variable is and always has been the American intervention and imperial machine. And if you spend all of your time critiquing countries that are responding to that, rather than working as hard as you damn can to prevent continued expansion of that empire, then you aren't taking the issues in those countries seriously. You're undermining the very reason that they exist.",

Don't wait for the midterms because at best we will go back to a quiet but still vitriolically violent state. And at worst they will nominate another loser-ass moderate candidate and the fascist will just become more and more empowered.

    "text": "Uh, Will, you can resist American interference without shutting down civil liberties. How? Explain to me step by step how you can actually end American interference without shutting down some civil liberties. Because like we shit on China a lot for the great firewall of China like maybe we should, but also if they didn't have that, we would just Cambridge Analytica them on any election they do try and host. You can't tell me we want it because we have like we do it all the time to almost every newly decolonized area ever. When they host a free and fair election, we fund opposition parties, we kill opposition leaders, we threaten sanctions or intervention or we surreptitiously mess with their social medias. The literal only way that you actually undermine American intervention like if America funds a protest party in your country, what do you do about it other than shutting down that protest party? And like once again, the people that are going to shit post in my comments are not going to get this far. But I'm not saying all of the shutdowns of non-American countries of civil liberties are justified. That's not my belief. But if you genuinely think you can prevent American interference as long as the most powerful empire and its propaganda machine ever is working to undermine your sovereignty without sacrificing some civil liberties, you're deluded. And yes, sure, some places use that as an excuse, some places are wrongly shutting down civil liberties. But it is a significant portion, right? Like if you kept being invaded and cood and invaded and cood and invaded and cood and everyone around you got invaded and cood, you might be a little scared that if you do open up to an election, America will just fund the alternative party and you'll meet or leave out in your whole country, be sold out to Americans. Like I think that's a reasonable fear. And if that's not taken into account before you critique or attack or undermine any country outside of America, you're not doing so in good faith, you're doing because the empire tells you to. And that scares me. Much more. Much more. So yes, I stand in solidarity for all people fighting for all of their civil liberties everywhere. The largest block to those civil liberties is and always has been American intervention.",

In order to be able to actually defend yourself in a way that the regime would not like, you need to know that there are people that would defend you from that regime. There needs to be someone that will bring your groceries if you have to stay at home. There needs to be someone that will shelter you if they want to throw you in jail illegally. For a fewer person that's at risk of deportation or expulsion, there needs to be communities to both provide and support and defend and hide you. I think many people conceive of the idea that if the fascists get bad enough action will naturally follow, but that's not true, because the largest thing preventing people from resisting is not enough anger at the regime. I think a lot of people are really angry at the regime, but an organization and functional structure to enable that resistance. So if you want to start working towards that today, I promise you there are your area that are going by the name of community defense, mutual aid, or some form of union that are organizing right now to help defend you and your community. And if there isn't, see if there's a socialist party in the area, and otherwise found one.",

And I know you don't, because in two years when a billion dollars is spent to convince you that the Democrats will solve all of this, you'll fall for it again. I know you don't because a lot of y'all, when you saw what was happening in Iran or Venezuela, you didn't immediately think of the Iraq War. You didn't think of Libya or Syria. And like, I'm not perfect on this either. I'm reactive, we're all reactive to some extent. None of us are perfect. But the short outrage reactive machine that the empire can incite in us with massive media, with pushing something just on the front of New York Times, serves their interests very well. Because in that short, one to two days of most people's political memory, they can make up facts because frankly, facts are scarceth in the first two days. Right? Remember October 8th and 9th when we didn't know that the IDF actually killed a lot of people on October 7th. And then they can use that outrage to do the military intervention they want to do and then they can get out. I mean, obviously Israel did it, but America did with Venezuela. And we need a much longer political memory because if they can just kill the people that are effective at resistance, they can kill their memory too. If they can spend millions in Coindell Pro to get rid of any effective resistance or billions overall in operation condor. So you need a much longer political memory, not only to be able to effectively resist being complicit in imperial aims, supporting American intervention, supporting American imperial aims in the very diverse way they are. But also to respect the memory and learn from the effective techniques of resistance fighters that they found challenging enough that they had to unalive, that they had to attack. And this is obviously coming off of a week of extreme heat, extreme rapid response. And I don't like doing that reporting. And I hope y'all don't either because facts are scarcin' it, opinions are very wide, and the Empire's propaganda machine is working hard. And none of us can beat that. But what we can do is choose to learn from history and let that inform us. Rather than the multi-billion dollar propaganda machine convincing you that whatever the American Empire wants, that's the right one.",

Any of the people that America later slurred from Ho Chi Minh to Lamumba to the president of Indonesia and Brazil, America slurred as America haters who hate freedom and democracy, but actually many of them appealed directly to those values, calling for America to help them fight off their colonial rulers in Indochina, France, in Indonesia, the Dutch, in Congo, the Belgians, one of the founding conferences of the non-aligned movement was made explicitly to reference Paul Revere's, the British are coming, the British are coming night, and Ho Chi Minh explicitly appealed to the Declaration of Independence, but almost universally, these leaders from even Mao at certain points who appealed to America to fight its internal and external enemies were attacked, undermined, and destroyed by America. And so I think we can have an intelligent discussion about any leader from the past 100 years, whatever, but I think it's important to start by undermining this idea that they simply existed as USSR-backed pawns. They simply existed in this grand strategy game between America and communism. No, the primary aim of many of them was simply self-determination for their nation, and many of them made the mistake of ever believing that America's revolutionary values aligned with that, because America's revolution was a bourgeois revolution, and they all very quickly learned that America's freedom has never been the type of freedom that oppressed peoples believe in, but has been the type of freedom that allows colonizers to continue oppressing people.",

There is no opposition to fascism that maintains ice. There is no opposition to fascism that continues ethno-fascist organizations like the Department of Homeland Security. It is literally not possible to fight fascism if you cannot observe the ethno-fascist genocide that Israel is committing right now.

So if you don't even have the backbone to push back against a ethno-fascist like Ben Shapiro in a fucking podcast, you certainly don't have the balls to be US President and fight face to face the fascists.

And if anything signals the death knell of the neoliberal order, which is the influence networks, the complex political economy by which America and the West generally controlled the world, it is this. Because Canada is America's number one trade partner, and America has worked very hard to control the relationships that their trade partners can have with China. And this is such a fucking spit in the face of that work, openly and as it should, because China's a sovereign country and so is Canada, they have every right to sign in a trade agreement. This signals something larger along with a lot of other things, and actually should be good context for White Trump once Greenland, which is that the soft influences the economy that America built up over the past 70 years of building a hegemonic empire through the IMF and WTO and building of NATO. All of these things are falling apart. NATO is dying before our eyes. And instead of doing it through soft power, America and the fascists in charge currently want to do it through hard power. They literally want to expand America, forcing puppet leaders into Venezuela, pushing for regime change in Iran. And of course, grabbing Greenland. And that is because the tacit and consistent and very effective pressure they used to do is falling apart in front of their eyes. And in its place, they want America to be a very powerful poll in multiple polls. And the only way to be a powerful poll, multiple polls where you can't have tacit control of the whole world like we used to have is by massively expanding. But it will cost them that soft power and can the seeing that and acting on it.",

They are telling you that your only option is to give up and choose the blue fascist rather than the red one. And they might be right about American imperial elections, but their answer is wrong. It is not to bend the knee and put your whole back into supporting the blue fascist. It is to fight as hard as you conceivably can against fascists of all forms. And the reason that they're doing this is quite obvious. They take money from billionaires and special interests than the oligarchs that fascism, blue or red was created to protect. That means that the answer for us is just clearer, which is to fight these motherfuckers just as hard as we fight the motherfuckers currently throwing people in concentration camps.

The goal is so that you respond to their propaganda correctly, which is that you don't debate, oh well maybe it is dangerous, but this time they overreacted. No, they did exactly as they were trained to do, which is to terrorize and brutalize until you just comply. And to say that their violence is not a response to what we would be perfectly well entitled to, which is self-defense and community defense, but it is actually their goal, and the only thing that will prevent that violence is people responding in the natural way of actually defending themselves, which the data shows they clearly have not. So they're going to continue claiming they're doing this terrorism just because they're so scared, because they need to overreact, because they don't understand how scary it is, but you'll know, that's not why. Their job is to do the violence and then find excuses for the violence, and the only thing that ends that, not the thing they're responding to, is to actually defend yourself from that violence.",

Of course, someone isn't just going to openly say they want to steal resources. We have to lie about weapons mass destruction. And liberals, like the New York Times, will focus on Trump's obsession with the Nobel Peace Prize as a justification for him personally wanting this, despite the long historical justification for it strategically. But that's the difference in playbooks. The fascists galvanize their base. They get their base excited and having bloodlust, not through lying about humanitarian causes, exactly like George W. Bush and Buckland did. But by being very open about the violence that they're committing, and the glory to the nation that that will bring. But that's only half the story, because Trump also wants Greenland literally because his plans require America to be dependent. He is destroying the global hegemony that America has created for itself, which relies on Europe being cucked to us. And to some extent, us paying for Europe's defense. It relies on us not being that antagonistic towards China. It relies on us maintaining relationships with countries that he called shithole nations. He is a American ethno-nationalist. He believes in America as a very powerful nation amongst nations. Neo-Liberals believe in America as the global police and hegemonic police force of the world. And so Trump doesn't want to run the whole world anymore. I don't think that's what he wants. What he wants is a super-powerful America. And he is willing to burn the allies we made to help run the world. If it can mean a more powerful America, and that's very clear what Greenland is. He's expanding America's literal, disur-power. But burning a lot of our de facto power. But that is exactly the playbook of a person that is willing and likely going to, to line the pockets of the billionaires that help support him, go to war with the allies or people that are allied with our allies.",

So this MLK day, I join in the flurry of voices calling on you to read what he actually said. Starting with the letter from a Birmingham jail where he advocates explicitly, proviolating laws that breed injustice to his open critiques of the white moderate, who is more comfortable and devoted to order than justice, to his open critiques of capitalism suggesting that the evils of capitalism are as real as racism and militancy. A mutual of mine has made a much more cohesive reading list on this, and he is tagged below because this MLK day, remember MLK, as he actually was, not an advocate of passive, merely peaceful protest, but a man who understood that a riot is the language of the unheard, that racism and capitalism are entrenched and intertwined, and that the white moderate does not have the right to set the timetable for liberation, and do not allow them to kill and suppress the actual memory of him, as they have tried so hard to do.",

They are repeating the oldest trope in the book, which is that minorities can only be successful, only be independent, only even be comparable to white people if they are committing fraud, if they are criminal, if they are undermining, if they are betraying, if they are poisoning your nation. This has happened time and time and time again, and this is just the newest edition of it. We shouldn't treat it as anything different than that because they'll just make up a new one. But what we should do is recognize it for what it is, which is yet another edition of that, and an opportunity to mobilize and organize to protect those independent communities, to defend their independence and success, and to copy how they were independent, how they were successful, learn from it, grow from it, and learn how to undermine the white supremacists that find that so scary, because they find it scary for a reason. And it's because if a black, brown person, can be successful independently, not through simulation and submission to the white supremacist system, but through alternative power structures, that is the scariest thing, not only to the white supremacist mind, but to the power system that they created to maintain their system.",

    "text": "You're an angry white person and you said you want to join the Black Panther Party and everyone laughed. What do you do? Well, you laugh along with them because it's silly, but then you organize, because there are ways that white people can be effective accomplices to black revolutionary aims. Which, let's be clear, was the central unifying tenant of the Black Panther Party, and they did not take white members as members of the Black Panther Party generally. Rather, they participated in the Rainbow Coalition of different organizations, including the young patriots which were poor white southerners. I don't think that literal same setup would work today, and I don't think anyone thinks that. But what you can do right now as a white person if you want to help, as an accomplice to the oppressed nations in America, is you can go out and build community amongst other white people to help do that. And first and foremost, mobilization against ICE is a huge organizing round. If you haven't already, go find the Ice Watch Organization in your area, and you will find the people who need help. And you will find the communities that are willing to defend those people. And if you don't find effective revolutionary community in that area, find or found mutual aid organizations, or community defense organizations, because you don't just need to defend yourself against ICE, the cops are also very violent. And there is a lot of writing on this that I'm not doing justice to, to how to be an effective accomplice to Black Revolutionary aims. But I think the answer should be obvious in attempting to do that, listen to Black Revolutionaries, where they will engage in the Black Panther Party or whatever formation that comes up now. And there will be demands for white people. There will be requests for white people just as there were in the original Black Panther Party days. And the best way you can prepare right now to provide and help in those revolutionary aims and provide liberation for America as a whole from the fascist regime that hurts us all through white supremacy as well, is by building revolutionary community to engage in mutual aid which enables effective community defense. And the bar I always use is that if you're not prepared for a jail break, you're not prepared to actually resist the state. So start preparing today for all of those weird ass logistics that that would take.",

And though he was murdered by the former colonizers of Congo, aided and abetted by the current colonizers of much of Africa, the Pan-Africanist icons, ideals of third-worldism and Pan-Africanism live on today with people still to this day, even very recently, referencing and memorializing Lamumba. And when we say that every democratic socialist was murdered for their beliefs, this is what we mean, not even just democratic socialism, but anyone, especially third-worldists, that worked very hard to provide any type of democracy or sovereignty for their formerly colonized countries, from Indonesia to Congo to Brazil, were undermined, attacked, and many times literally murdered by the colonizers that wanted to maintain control over those areas. And so while there was an infinite amount of things to be said about Lamumba, and you should go read what he believed, I'm not even going to attempt to summarize the fantastic work that he did, the thing I do want to point you to is that if you ever feel called to critique individuals, actions, organizations, or even regimes that have survived or are fighting those imperialists, in the memory of all that those imperialists literally murdered to kill the ideas of, you ought to take a breath and consider whether whatever defects in those movements, ideals, regimes, you are raising your breath to critique, would exist if America didn't force them into a position to consistently defend themselves, because sovereignty and democracy and control of one's own nation has always been directly in contradiction to America, and especially if you ever raise your mouth to call for America to intervene in anywhere, for the West to intervene in anywhere, first start with an understanding of the disastrous history of that action.",

And I feel like a lot of people on here, myself included at times, see every new escalation by ice and by the Trump administration domestically and foreignly, as a new opportunity to mobilize the people that are just now getting it. But there must be, at some point, in some scale, on some level, a transition from trying to get a wider and wider amount of the white liberal base that didn't realize, yeah, violence is going to get to them too, moving into mobilizing who we got, how? And some of that can't be done online, right? There are things I can't advocate even if I believe in them due to limitations and laws. But some of it can. And that's why I'm trying to focus more on telling y'all to go in person and organize. Have the conversations with your community and find the people that are willing to fight ice, find the people that are willing to fight the fascists in whatever form they come to your community, and find the people that aren't. Find the people that can be mobilized just to organize and find the people that can be mobilized to fight. Everyone has a different role in actually undermining the issue that we have. And part of that is understanding the issue that's in front of us. And so instead of treating every new escalation as a way to mobilize a wider tent, because that tent should be pretty damn wide when people are being shot on the street, take it as a data point in the very wide and probably much weaker than they are presenting, fascist network that we're presented with.",

I think there's a bit of a paradox here because they would love for us to spend all of our time repeating and going into the little crevices of Nazi ideology that they're pointing to and explaining every little thing. But that's also a waste of time. We could just decide that there are Nazis and move from there and stop asking questions about particularly which exact part of Nazi ideology are they talking about because trust me, I've dived into it. It's fucking complicated and it's all nonsense all the way down. But then again, for this like more and more and more lives that we can bring in by pointing out how clearly they're doing Nazi things. Yeah, it's a worthwhile endeavor to be like, look, they're really openly being Nazis. This isn't an accident's very opposite. But surely logically, it would only take one. When you only unapologetically, unaccidentally do one Nazi thing, liberals start acting like they're living under Nazi times, but they're not. And that's because not only is this in part a way to distract, but it is also somewhat useless because even if there's an ounce of rejectability, even if there's an ounce that, oh, maybe they didn't mean it all. Maybe it's just that department. A lot of liberals will use that ounce and strike on it and say, okay, we can just wait. Maybe they're bad. Maybe they're making mistake. Maybe they've hired a wrong person. But we can just wait till the next election. Maybe they're bad. Maybe they've hired the wrong person. But surely it's not the whole administration. Surely not using the whole security state that I supported to go after the, you know, there's scary brown people. Surely not using them to go after scary brown people internally. No. So yeah, I do some amount of this where I go into what the Nazis are saying and how it's not to shit. And that's I think in some cases, a worthwhile endeavor. But I also think there's a really, really important stopping point where when I'm speaking to leftists, we stop looking into how precisely the Nazis are commuticating with each other and what they're saying. But move very quickly into, okay, what are we doing about it? And when we're speaking to liberals, go live in a world where they are Nazis. What do you do? And if their answer is vote? Yeah, no, they don't give a fuck.",

And that is to say, a lot of fascists, propaganda right now, are saying, yeah, we didn't fucking invade Venezuela because we care about Venezuelans, we did that because we want oil, and then they're going on spending a lot time, explaining and justifying why they need another sovereign country's oil. Same thing with Iran, Liberals are talking a lot about the humanitarian situation there, whereas the fascists that would actually be acting and are actually in power are the ones saying, no, we don't give a fuck, we want to install a Western-backed dictator so that we get control over Iran's oil. And this is what I find so frustrating because like, yes, there are humanitarian concerns everywhere, but that's so far from the discussion when we have a literal, autocratic fascist in power that just wants to invade to make his capitalist friends way more money, right? He's not even doing the lies that George W. Bush, a Bill Clinton did for intervention, he's being honest and you don't have to lie on his behalf. You don't have to make up another possible justification for this fascist act. He's telling you why he's acting, take him seriously and repute him. And that's why at times it seems like I'm attacking Liberals on this issue more because the fascists I don't need to attack, they're not hypocritical at least on this issue. They're hypocritical fundamentally, right? They're nationalists that believe in violating other nations. But what they're saying is true. Yeah, I mean, America would be stronger if it got control of Iran's oil. Yeah, it would be stronger if it got control of Venezuela's oil. I just don't think we should be able to go in and slaughter people to steal the oil to make America arbitrarily stronger. I actually want a much weaker America. But it's the liberals that are being hypocritical and thus have something to talk to. I have nothing to talk to an evil person about. I have something to talk to a liar that's pretending to be good.",

    "text": "Yes, ISIS like slave catchers and the Nazis, and they're like the apartheid South African white supremacists. I'm not trying to like both sides the clear issue going on online right now, but I'm trying to say that the composition of ICE as a fascist force is complex, and some of the maintain the American security state tradition of being like slave catchers, that's true. But some of them are very explicitly neo-Nazi white supremacists that their ideology comes from, like Nazi Germany explicitly or the Afro-Connaissance Freedom movements. And like I think people are right when they know, like especially the Black and brown people, that when we point out that ICE is like slave catchers, white people tend to get really uncomfortable, because then they have to face that also cops are like slave catchers, and they have to demonize someone new that they previously might have felt comfortable with. But we should not really be satisfied with like a flat, cohesive, all-encompassing narrative around them, not only because it's not as helpful, but it's also not literally true, because white supremacy has evolved and developed, especially in response in America to the massive influx of Latino immigrants. Something there is a tradition of, but also is comparably new. It also evolved with the integration into the internationalist fascist fronts across South Africa, Rhodesia, when they left went to Israel, and when they left and went to Australia, and New Zealand, all of these work together develop new ideas and different strategies that influence each other. And if you want undermine ICE and DHS, and all of these things that have been hiring and integrating white supremacy and white supremacist ideals into them, not only to understand their propaganda, which is openly like a very classic taste of American white supremacy, but also their aim, strategies and tolerances, for example, why they tolerate Stephen Miller, a Jewish man being so high up in an openly neo-Nazi cabinet. You need to have a better understanding of the American white supremacist movement, but also the international fascist movements that led into it. And so yes, they're like neo-Nazis, yes, they're importantly like slave catchers, and importantly there's some uberly, goobly, like weird slot mix of them all. And there's important things to be said from all of those angles.",

But that's because I want you to think about what the term Homeland Security in this context means. Because we already have military, we already had a border patrol which has long been infiltrated by KKK members. DHS was made specifically in response to 9-11, where we were attacked by our largest ideological enemies, and we had to show not only that we were going to attack them back, but also that we are a proud, strong nation with a particular identity. And DHS was part of that massive increase in militancy. And so when you see them doing Nazi shit, you shouldn't be surprised, because Naziism is by definition, right? Fascism by definition is defined by a people that believe in a need for a rebirth of a nation. They are embarrassed nationalists who believe in a rebirth and recreation of a mythical nation. And DHS is part of that. It was born out of one of the largest national embarrassments, 9-11, and then did exactly what fascists think nations need to do to prove their value, a shit ton of violence. And now that violence is just becoming more and more and more aimed inwards, as the infrastructure for that violence was created by liberals and, you know, neocons alike. And so if you want to understand ICE, you have to understand the largest security apparatus that we built around it that enables it. And that forget the love of God did not start under Trump. It didn't even really start under the beginning of DHS, but that's a good place to start.",

Maybe famously all of the orders from the USSR to work within liberal democracy is that. What? And there are also famous examples of liberals working with Islamists. I mean, America helped fund the Musya Hadin, and Islamist organization, specifically to fight communists, right? Like, what are you talking about? This is literally just saying, my enemies are bad, and I'm having a big conspiracy against me to suppress me on the basis of my identity. That's like literally the foundational conspiratorial thinking that leads to anti-Semitism, my friend. Like, when you group all of your enemies in one big group and think there's a magical and conspiracy acting explicitly to suppress you and your identity, especially when it's simplified to the fact that they just naturally do this. That's conspiratorial thinking on a next level, and doing so in a way that is just divorced from reality, right? Zoromundani by no definition is a communist, AOC by no definition is a communist, and Zoromundani by no definition is a must. But Daniel Ryan's folding, I see why you get here as a right-wing propagandist, because the undercurrents of fascism that you have been supporting are lead to this. They necessitate an esoteric evil that you can fight, that is fundamentally attacking your identity, your culture. But that's not happening. That's not a real thing that actually exists. Communists by and large have been more religiously tolerant than liberals. That's the history of the actual world. Liberals have funded lots of Islamist groups. Communists have funded some Islamist groups, and they've also collaborated with liberals. To say their sub-fundamental and consistent conspiracy is nonsense, and it only serves to help you mobilize your kind of nascent fascists to acting, because they feel there's an existential threat, when in fact they are the existential threat.",

Because if you are observing now, correctly, that ice has been hiring and is largely in collaboration with far right wing white supremacist organizations like Ident Europa, Proud Boys, although January 6th invaders, then boy do I have a story to tell you about the fucking cops. There's a reason the cops in clan have always gone hand in hand and it's often because they were the same goddamn hands. So if you want to take seriously, rather than just having an immediate reaction to a massive increase in openly brutal violence, the threat of the American security state, you need to face it where it's at, which is the ice is not that special. I mean, ice is a little special. They're distinctive and they're different in that they're primarily shock troops for the current leader and they have just so much fucking more money. But the tradition of violence against black and brown bodies, they are maintaining is not new. It's 250 years old at least. And if you're concerned about them hiring members of the Proud Boys, you should be concerned about how much the KKK has infiltrated the cops in those 250 years. At certain points, KKK uniforms were literally cop outfits. I eat the cops wore KKK robes. The KKK would never change for the cops. Come on now. So I'm happy that Libs are getting on the train of fuck ice. Welcome. But if you're going to have that energy and need to keep it up against all the violence workers of the American Empire, from yes ice to the cops to yeah, I hate to say it, the military. Because the violence work they're doing from Iraq to Iran to Syria to Lebanon to Palestine is coming back. And there's a reason a lot of ice agents are veterans. It's not just because veterans are really fucked over by the system, which is true in something to be discussed, but it's often also because the training they received is immediately applicable to violence against black and brown bodies in America.",

If you're talking about the American Empire, I will think you are wrong. But regime change specifically describes those humanitarian interventions the American Empire engages in that changes one regime into another. And very often, the second one, the only difference is not that they're less brutal, oftentimes they're more brutal, but that they serve American interests more. This term came about because we were talking about Nicaragua Guatemala, Chile, and Argentina, where America barely, I mean, we tried to manufacture concern in somewhat successfully, but a very thin veneer of justification over what was very obviously in the corporate's interest. And in the name of liberating the people who in some cases had genuine grievances about the previous regime, though in many of those cases it was largely a democratically elected leader. The new leader didn't liberate them, but sold them out to American interests, brutalized and genocide at them. So we can have an intelligent discussion about America's role in the world. I think America's role is to cease to exist, but there could be, you know, reasonable disagreements with my obviously correct position. That's okay, but don't call it regime change, then you're already conceding the argument.",

Trump openly threatened military action against Colombia after the Venezuela invasion, deepening anti-US sentiment among grassroots groups.\n\nDespite a phone call that eased immediate diplomatic tensions, protests continued in Bogot\u00e1 and other cities. Colombians mobilised beyond official channels, driven by fear of foreign intervention and a demand that Washington respect national sovereignty.",

Which is that they don't only exist internally, due to America's internal bigotries against immigrants, nor are they just being used by this fascist. But they were made as a consequence of the biggest thing that creates fascists, which is a national embarrassment. And America at the time tried to correct this national embarrassment on the domestic and foreign stage. On the foreign stage, they did this by saying, we're going to go take out the people that did this, and we're going to use a massive show of force. The violence wasn't an accident. It was to show the American people that they were still strong and that those people that they demonized, that animalized and said, were weak, didn't just come in and attack them. But we also did this internally with a massive increase in anti-immigrant rhetoric, anti-Muslim rhetoric. We said, no, no, no, our nation isn't embarrassed. It's being undermined. It's being corrupted. The soul of our nation is being poisoned. And I think you can see, as I just did there, how it can very fastly and effectively become fascism, because that's the narrative of fascism, is your nation has been embarrassed and it needs to have a rebirth. In Fall of 9-11, that's exactly what we needed. And also, we created the security apparatus around those things. We created a security apparatus massively targeting terrorism, which very often has just been defined by the enemy of America, whoever he designated the mass. And we also created the security apparatus inside from the Patriot Act, right? A massive, massive violation of our separate liberties, which enabled the expansion of the ANSA. And now these two worlds are colliding as the Imperial Broom of Rang, boomerangs right back, where ICE is being trained by the IDF, which was massively utilized in our war against Iraq and interventions in Syria. Right, these two things are directly related. And with ICE now targeting cartel members, saying everything's a cartel and Trump labeling the cartels what? Terrorists. And so I think there are a lot of people noticing the connoities with American fascism, which is true and I do a lot, like the fact that the cops in clan have always gone hand in hand, and that they are using the same strategies, you know, 200 years ago, they used as slave catchers. But I also think there's an important point here, which is that many of the mobilizing moments for the white supremacists in ICE was, yes, laid on the groundwork of American Nazism, American racism, and settler coloniness violence. But it was watered and it grew in the context of a very particular embarrassment in American history.",

And a lot of people don't understand that because a lot of people hold non-violence to be a value, but there is no dignity in losing. There is no dignity on being on one side of a losing battle and not using the weapons you have in front of you. For example, the Liberation Movement in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. The largest front of that proclaimed non-violence, but the reason that had any teeth was because under it was a movement with very effective violence. Not only internally, with laborers and militants uprising, but also externally, with Myanmar already having been excluded from the Raj due to effective resistance in part, complicated history. Nelson Mandela actually helped found a violent arm of the ANC that actually did violence to help end apartheid. And it was only that underlying threat that effectuated the non-violent actions of the ANC, similar with the American Civil Rights Movement, where there was a non-violent front, and then a very clearly openly self-defensive front. And there is a lot of whitewashing of all of those histories. So if you're interested in actually being effective and you're telling me that only non-violence is effective, learn you get damn history. And if you're telling me only non-violence is moral, then you are telling everyone being affected by the immediate violence to just sit down and accept that they've lost.",

But we need to start treating them every time they fail to end the ice gistapo that are in our street kidnapping, brutalizing, and killing us. Every time they fail to protect us from that, they are complicit in doing that. It is not an accident. It is violence. And you don't just negotiate with the people committing violence against you.

    "text": "ICE is the classic fascist state within a state, and I need you to understand what that strategy means. Which is that very often fascist co-opped the state in some ways, but also created an alternative, more loyal, and well-funded state within it. For example, the famous example of the SS is here, where the SS was basically created by the Nazis, or massively expanded and funded by them, and only let loyalists in, and with recent, although entirely expected, revelations that ICE is largely staffed by former proud boys, or at the very least they don't bet them out, the parallel should be obvious, which is that the goal is to give over $100 billion to the loyalist that support Trump, and then anything they can't get away with right now, they say is a mistake, and then they slowly start being able to get away with them more. And then when the state, which in its own self-interest sometimes reacts against fascists, poorly fecklessly and uselessly, that's what we're seeing under the Democrats right now. But when they catch up, they don't have $100 billion, and loyalists that will do anything you want, defending and attacking them. They don't have well-armed, well-trained, willing to die for the state's soldiers to defend against the fascists. And so right now what we're seeing is a build up of that army, a build up of that military, and you need to catch on real quick to what that actually is, because it's not new strategy. It's very similar to what we did in Indonesia, it's very similar to what the fascists did in Nazi Germany, it's very similar to some extent what the brown shirts were. And if your observation of ice being the brown shirts and starts and ends with them being brutal, that's not good enough. You need to understand the role they actually play, not just to be brutal, but to be extremely effective at centralizing power.",

This is for you, because fascist whole entire propaganda technique is to make you feel hopeless and make you feel powerless.

The first time ice turns away, because you got there with a whistle, you will feel powerful. The first time you teach tenants how to organize and fight back against evil landlords, you will feel powerful and that shit snowballs. So the more people we get involved, the more people we get connected, the more people we get organized. That's the goal, and that's always been the goal of this platform. To give you all the ideological tools to fight back against any of the narratives that work against you, building power. The second you have a community to build that power with, it gets ten times easier. So don't start with yourself, don't go out and get a gun. That could be another thing later. The first and foremost thing is if they try and arrest you, who do you have to call? If you get disappeared, who do you have to call? If they try and make your life much harder, much more expensive, who will fight back against it? Because they can't disappear everyone, or they can try, but if we're an organized, damn no way we're going to effectively fight back.

And people are thinking he's stupid for this, but I don't think he's stupid. Or more so, I don't think his actions are. I think he is. But you know what I think has a plan? This guy, this guy's a Nazi, and you know what Nazis do? Invade. Because the Nazi economy of pillage and plunder relies on finding new places to steal from. So Stephen Miller sees the writing on the wall. The American economy will break with competition in China, right, with destroying our internal industry, with a obvious bubble in AI. And in order for his regime to maintain power and support, he must go and pillage and plunder other places. That is why he wants Greenland, which possibly has natural resources, for example, natural gas or oil. And that is why he wants Venezuela. All of this gives him justification to fund the military, contractors that are paying for his job in the first place, and actually provide funding from it by extracting their resources. So yes, people are accurately noticing that Trump is not lying anymore. Trump is not pretending anymore, but do not read that as much as ignorance, as a different strategy. Instead of justifying Blitzkrieg by ignoring it, what you do is you galvanize the nationalist base that you've built up in the past 10, 20 years, who are willing to say, yeah, America should go steal it. And you piss off the 60% of Americans that don't believe that, but are too damn feckless to do anything about it. That is exactly how the fascist functioned. They paid and supported the people that would support them, and they just didn't lie about what they were doing. Barring, of course, what they were doing domestically. They did lie about that, but they didn't lie about the invasions.",

Which is to say that we condemned Saddam Hussein and his actions rightfully so. And then every single condemnation was used to justify intervention. There were grassroots activists against Saddam Hussein and every single time as highlighted in the American media it was used to do what? Intervention and invasion. We gave conditional sanctions and we gave deals and we were really reasonable against Saddam Hussein and that was used to do what? Intervention in kill three to six million people. So there is a discussion to be had about how to deal with oppressive governments. There is a discussion to be had about America's role in contributing to the world economy and different terror states. But if that discussion is not centrally and staunchly centered in a deep kind of fear, I mean it is a fear of our propaganda being centered and circulated around for the American empire's purpose. We're not doing that right and we're certainly not doing a service to the people we want to help. So I'm really, I mean you know my answer. I don't want America to intervene at all. I actually want a drastic reduction in the American security state and I think as Americans that is the most effective thing you can do to call for. But you don't have to agree. People disagree reasonably. That's okay. But if you're not centering the discussion in the actual history and actual study of the propaganda that you're responding to 10, 20 years ago, you're not going to do a good job parsing through the very difficult job that is going through this propaganda and seeing what's true, seeing what's not.

Or more so, they occupy the same place in the Imperial playbook, which is a helpful demon. And this is played out a lot of different ways because there are genuine grievances against Hamas. There are genuine grievances against anybody, but America and Israel don't care. And we know that in a series of ways. First and foremost, because they don't actually want what's best for the people that are leveraging those grievances, for example, when they leveraged the protests against Hamas, you know what they did? Bomb the protesters. And the same thing is happening here. The vast majority of Venezuelans did not support foreign intervention to remove Middoro. And yet America did it because it served their interests. Same thing we did with Saddam Hussein. We didn't actually make Iraqis lives better. We made Iraq more useful for America. And so I will and have pointed out hundreds of contradictions with this. It is obvious that America doesn't care about the Iranian people. It is obvious that America doesn't care about the Venezuelan people. And that is why you should stand staunchly against American intervention and don't engage in these hypothetical debates as to whether intervention can conceivably lead to good things. When we know with the actual American empire that's in front of us, it won't. And when the same playbook happens again and again and again, where they want you to focus on the genuine grievances that they themselves don't give a fuck about, you need to start recognizing it rather than falling for it.",

If you read Henry Kissinger's book, it's very clear, right, the harbinger of fucking American imperialism intended for interventions to be justified by lies, but very intentionally destructive. Because the wind condition for the American Empire is not just installing a strong puppet, but installing a weak regime that can't actually fight it, and preferably a regime that doesn't respect human rights, so that at any time, American can rally the empathetic left against that regime, if that regime pisses it off. And once again, this is a part of the analysis, not a whole of the analysis, it's a short video. But we need to understand that I'm not screaming about sanctions just because I think they're a poorly thought out policy. I think they're a very well thought out policy.

Because that analysis is hard. I have my opinion. I have my analysis and it's back from my understanding of what I have read from Iranians and non-Aranian academics. But my god, I get in a very powerful media storm getting caught up in different propaganda. And that is not a sin that is an inevitability. And we have our choice on how we respond to that inevitability. Do we respond with grace and understanding and interest? Or do we respond with the tools that the American Empire gives us of puritanism, moralism, and universalizing? I think we should do the first one. And this isn't just self-interested. I'm happy to go ten toes fucking down on my position against intervention, against sanctions, and against monarchy. But this is in a good faith aim to be like, most Americans are really dumb. Myself included. When we're dumb about a new thing, truly don't be surprised.",

If not, and you're calling for American intervention for regime change in Iran or Venezuela, or now even fucking Greenland, you're falling for American propaganda one way or another. Because there are reasonable ways to get to that conclusion about Venezuela and Iran. But if you are American and that is your focus, that is what you're talking about singularly along with the whole entire American media machine. It's very likely that what's deciding that focus is not your singular autonomous independent humanitarian aims, but the multi-billion dollar profit and machine aiming to push for American intervention in Iran. And so like before we even get to a substantive discussion about American intervention before I start pointing out how evil American intervention is, how much I actually think it will reinstate an autocratic monarch that will brutalize the Iranian people more. We need to cut through the multi-billion dollar profit and machine. And once again, I will never say that is all that is what is happening. But if you are an American and that's all you're talking about or thinking about, that is almost certainly why you're talking about it. Not the genuine grievances of Iranians, because I know you're ignoring the genuine grievances of immigrants in Qatar. I know you're ignoring the genuine grievances of Palestinians in Jordan. I know you're ignoring the genuine grievances of Saudi Arabian immigrants or the Congolese against the UAE. I know that, right? Or at the very least you and no one else the American political machine are calling for intervention on the basis of it. Because you don't have to be focusing on everything. But if you're calling for intervention, you damn better be consistent. And so I know there's another variable. What's the variable? The multi-billion dollar profit again machine. You know, like that's how that logic works. And so I think a lot of people get a reactive thing. No, this is a real issue. Yeah, it is. But that's not what even we're getting to talk about. And I would love to talk about it. But unfortunately all my energy has to be spent, undermining one of the most powerful propaganda machines that the world has ever seen.",

The Slander campaign and the propaganda campaign multi-million dollar propaganda campaign they did against slandering Venezuela and its regime provides cover and justification for this act.

But for the love of fucking God, don't catch me, not condemning the liberal's evil shit. Fuck y'all. And anyone saying who is a Democrat condemning the capture of Maduro? If they're not asking for Maduro to be returned, they aren't actually condemning it. If they're not calling for an end to the sanctions against Venezuela that killed thousands of civilians, they're not condemning it. They are just bothered that Trump did it openly.",

I know to the American brain that sounds counterproductive, but it's pretty damn well studied that sanctions generally have a negative correlation with democratization. And that's not even to fucking mention that American intervention and the corrosive effect that sanctions have had led to the millions of deaths. And it's really hard to vote when you're dead if you want democracy in an area from Venezuela to Iran to Syria. The first step is to end American intervention through its proxies, through its economic battles, and through its actively coercive policies. And I understand that you see a bad thing and you want to punish it. That's Americanism. Stop. It doesn't actually really work. The reason I want sanctions against Israel is because I want to end American intervention in that area. And supporting Israel literally is American intervention. I just don't want any more American money going to there as an American. It's very infuriating when people compare ending American support for its own proxy as a sanction to us, you know, illegally stripping Cuba of its economic freedom to trade with other people by invading or threatening military economic action against anyone that does. They're not the same thing. They have a different effect and there's a different consequence. Being an enemy of the American Empire is extraordinarily harmful to any internal democracy.",

China, or Mithia Venezuela, things like that are militant, or as the Empire would call them, authoritarian. And you can have serious moral critiques of them, but I just when you're making those critiques want you to understand, America murdered most other people that weren't like them. Like that is the ending thesis of this book, which outlined the process by which we murdered everyone that didn't have to physically arm and militantly protect their society against the American Empire. Because when democratic socialists relied on the electoral structures, American money could always beat them and then would just go in and kill all of them. For example, in Indonesia, the PKI was a democratic socialist organization, right? Not in the modern understanding, they were very communist, but because they didn't aim for armed revolution, they actually weren't armed much at all. And then America committed a coup in Indonesia and slaughtered all of them. We also did that in Chile, where we overthrew a democratically elected socialist with a strong democratic base, installed Pinochet and slaughtered everyone. We did a very similar thing in Nicaragua. We did a very similar thing in Argentina, right? So none of these things are all the same and lots of variables go into everything. But when you start critiquing and joining in a long chorus of critiques against these regimes or these governments for their actions, for their authoritarianness, for their militancy, first consider, okay, that can be true, but what was the alternative? Because many of the alternative, as we have seen play out, is either they were militant, which comes with limitations on civil rights, or they fell to the American empire. And you can in good faith say, yeah, they should have fallen to the American empire rather than end up where they were. But I want you to know that that's the decision you're making because that is. And that's effectively the thesis of my new all-time favorite book from last week, the Jakarta method, which outlined this method by which we slaughtered all the time. But cybersecurity.",

    "text": "I need y'all to understand, democracy is incompatible with empire, even if that empire is not immediately intervening. Let me explain. Whenever we think of America intervening in democracy, we often think of things like a rock where we literally invade it, but that's kind of the tip of the iceberg, and there are three really good examples of this, which is sanctions, kind of soft intervention, the implicit and continued threat from all those other interventions, and the left over political violence from previous interventions. So let's go through three examples. Nicaragua 1990. That's sanctions. America did a lot of things. We funded a terrorist organization of the Contras that are fascists who eventually won that election in 1990, but ostensibly that election was free and fair, barring some violence by the Contras. But the main turning point was that America said that they would stop the crippling sanctions if the Contras won over the Sandinistas a wildly popular socialist party. That's not democracy, that's coercion. Two, the threat of invasion. America has invaded almost every socialist country that has existed or attempted to undermine their existence. If you are a historically third world, right, we would call it a peripheral state of the empire, not in the imperial core, you as a government know that, and you know that if you say something that upsets the American empire, you are next on the list. You know that if your party says out of line of the IMF or WTO, your party will be primary, will be funded against by the CIA. And so you preemptively comply. We can see this across Africa. And now the consequences of failing to follow that line in Mali, Burkina Faso, in Niger. And three, the left over violence of previous interventions. The best example by far of this is Indonesia, where Indonesia had the third largest communist party in the world, prior to American intervention, that through a very confused and very messy coup d'\u00e9tat, installed a far right wing fascist dictator who did slaughterings of over a million communists. And the amount of leftism due to, in part, that continued threat from America, but also because physically they murdered all the communists. There is not a strong left wing in Indonesia. So when you talk about democratizing a country, that is not possible, especially through forceful intervention by America, that by definition is undemocratic. But in the context of American impuilism, and as long as that American impuilism continues being a threat, which is reified every single time we physically or interventionally invade, you are undermining democracy, not building it. It's not just that by happenstance these things under my democracy, but by definition. And so if you want democracy anywhere, that starts with the end of empire here.",

They recognize the interconnected nature of all of their bigotry, even if it's on some like genuinely delusional nonsense, but beyond just recognizing the interconnectedness of their delusions of bigotry, which are very important considering they keep getting power and enforcing that bigotry, they also recognize their allies, Israeli fascists recognize their allies in the Hindutva movement in India. They recognize their allies in AFD who are vitrallically anti-Semitic, but don't want Jews in Germany. They recognize their allies in Trump, who believe in an American ethno-state, a white people, which naturally supports the ethno-static dreams of Israel, and the ethno-static dreams of India. And of course, the monarchist and ethno-static dreams of Shaw supporters in Iran. So if you want to undermine them, you don't just have to reject their concepts, but you have to understand them so that you can effectively fight them on every single battleground they're doing and build the effective coalition in which they are attacking. And they're attacking trans and gay and black and brown people and Asian people all for a very complex interconnected but cohesive-ish web. And if you want to actually undermine that, you need to understand it so you can unite the right people. Because they have their allies. Do you?",

And this, over anything else, shows that even free and fair elections cannot exist, as long as hegemonic imperial power controls the economy of a small country. Because the Sandinistas were wildly popular compared to the dictatorship that they took over from. The fascists that followed them were wildly unpopular, but the fascists had one thing on their side, which is that America would stop sanctioning to hell Nicaragua if the Sandinistas left. And so there was a free and fair election where America held the entire economy of Nicaragua as a threat against the Nicaraguan people to not elect the socialists. And so if you right now are calling for democracy anywhere, that call will always start with the inter-sanctions not just because many of the economic strikes that these countries that America uses to invade as justification for, is because of those sanctions from Iran to Venezuela to Cuba, but also because very definition sanctions from a hegemonic empire undermine the concept of democracy that you seem to be supporting.",

Every single action America has ever done, if you actually look at it, analytically, demonstrates they don't want democracy in Iran, so why would you think this action is different? It's mind-boggling to me. America only calls for democracy in that area against regimes that it doesn't like. It doesn't give a fuck about democracy in Saudi Arabia, it actually funds against it, it doesn't fuck about democracy in Jordan, it funds against it, actually democracy in that area is fundamentally oppositional to America's aims. All of these things are obvious if you look, but if you just look at one case, and the only option presented to you is American intervention, then yeah, I see how you get to that conclusion, because at some point it looks like any given regime is so horrible how could it get worse? Well, I promise you, it got worse. Right. What we did in Iraq made everything worse. What we did in Libya made everything worse. And so you need to expand the discussion. How can America act to reduce undemocratic practices in that area? And the first and most powerful thing we can do is end the illegal sanctions and stop funding a terror state that is used to galvanize these bases into military action. And if those aren't your first two demands, you're not taking this fucking seriously, at least not as American. I see how you get there as an Iranian, and I'm not here to critique Iranians, frankly, but if you're an American and that's your calls, you're not taking it seriously. You're just following the mainstream line.",

    "text": "Have you ever considered if sanctions actually work? Like, does sanctioning an authoritarian country make it more democratic? Because most people just assume that it does. If we sanction someone and punish them, they'll stop doing the thing we're punishing them for. But this has been pretty well studied. Like multiple times. And a large conclusion of this is that while some sanctions may occasionally work, wildly and on average, most sanctions levied against authoritarian countries actually make them less democratic. And that widely, they don't instigate the type of democratic reform that people are going for. Now, obviously from my position, I would expect this because I don't actually think sanctions, especially by the American Empire, are meant to punish non-democracy. We love non-democracy. We've instituted a bunch. From Jordan to Saudi Arabia to Brazil to Chile, we love it. What we're sanctioning to do is punish the country. But I think it's really important that we pierce this lie about sanctions that America spreads, which is that they're doing it for humanitarian reasons. And almost every humanitarian organization like this is asking us to sanction Israel, i.e. stop setting the billions of dollars to weapons, but stop the sanctions against the ones we're currently sanctioning because they're not changing the regime. They are destroying the humanitarian progress that we're making in that regime. And so to anyone that looks, it becomes pretty obvious that America is not sanctioning free-manitarian reasons. And the ones that would be working, we don't do. But I just need more people to look because there is so much like this that it is just assumed works, but flagrantly doesn't.",

If you're going to talk about geopolitics in America, you need to understand this because the people that want to bomb everything understand this. And it shouldn't be this way. We should be able to critique and attack anything, undermine it and try and build better things across the board. But when you're talking to Americans, because of a multi-billion dollar propaganda machine, they've been taught because of American exceptionalism and American imperial violence, that when they hear a critique of something being bad, especially outside of America, the answer is to bomb it. On the most simple example, we have like a rock because Saddam Hussein's regime being bad, bomb. Didn't help it, not a good solution, but that's the American solution. But now Trump's taking it to its logical extreme with like cartels in Mexico. Or at one point, he said, we should bomb hurricanes. Like the American obsession with using bombs and strikes to solve everything is not even an abstraction at this point. So if you're going to critique things online, you need to do it like this thing is bad and Americans that doesn't mean bomb it. It shouldn't be that way, right? We shouldn't have to do that, but that's the product of it. And the people that do one everything to be bombed do this. That's why you always hear this thing bad, not this thing bad and we shouldn't bomb it, not China bad and we shouldn't bomb it, right? No, it's China bad because they kind of want to bomb it.",

We have undermined almost every single effort of democratization in Iran we have ever seen. The British prior to us also supported the monarchs. We supported the Shah and his brutal shock trips.

Strikes don't work. That's why we've been striking Syria for the past 20 years. That's why we've been striking Yemen for the past 20 years because they don't work. And yet, the Imperial New York Times will do it every single time because the goal of their focusing on the protests was never for the Iranian people, never for the freedom of the Iranian people, never for the democratization of Iran. But was so that America, through whatever avatar they choose, can push its interests, and its interests have always been to destabilize Iran, because it stands as a bulwark in one way or another against American economic interests. It always has. That's why they were so scared of Saddam Hussein, not because of his human rights record. They were funding worse human rights records in Saudi Arabia. And this is why when we are reporting on it, when we are talking about when we are discussing it, we must be so staunchly, principally, and annoyingly anti-intervention. They are asking you if they want intervention. And if you don't say anything but no, it's a yes.",

American intervention has always been counter-democratic just as it was in 1953 in Iran where we overthrew a democratically elected leader.

This is why I said that when you were discussing what's happening in Iran, you must center anti-intervention. This is why I said that all of you were playing with fire when you discussed it without explicitly saying that America must not intervene. That America intervening would be counter-democratic.

You all don't understand how central everything you hear through the American propaganda machine is trying to push towards intervention and how fucking disastrous that is for anyone affected. And sometimes I'm reactionary. Sometimes I see an error and go, fuck, this was used to slaughter three to six million people in a rock, I'm not gonna repeat it. I'm gonna be antagonistic to it. And sometimes that's unjustified. But oftentimes it's not. Oftentimes it is a manufactured propaganda point, oftentimes it's highlighted, whatever, and it's very difficult in the moment to parse between those. But I think if a lot of people really quickly became a lot more fucking terrified of American invention than they are of American non-indireening, which history shows they should be, we would have an intelligent discussion about what to's to be done. Because right now in an ecosystem, where number one things are moving very, very quickly, it's very hard to get a cohesive line on something. But second of all, I'm speaking to hundreds of thousands of people that don't understand how dangerous the fire that is being played with is. I have to act as the person who just prevents anything from saying anything that even conceivably, possibly could be construed to create justification for intervention. And that restricts me in what I can say productively. And I don't know like that. I wanna be able to critique anyone, without it being actively by a multi-billion dollar propaganda machine misused, but that's not the situation we live in. So the best we can do right now is all of you join me very quickly in being staunchly, principally, and strongly anti-intervention, and we can have intelligent discussions amongst each other. But until that multi-billion dollar propaganda machine is not the loudest voice in every conceivable room, the biggest risk will always be contributing to it.",

Is Jewish identity only about religion? What do you think it is, Zionist? If you've ever wanted to... And then goes on to promote a website that claims to be answering questions for Jews on campus. But it conflates these three very distinct issues and conceptions of Judaism that are not historical. First of all, one is clear and flagrant anti-Semitism. The idea Jews control the government is anti-Semitic and making a website that counters anti-Semitism. Great. But then we go into a question that is very genuine, which is how do Jewish people conceive of themselves as a religion among other religions, as a tribe, as something that is national? Or ethnic? That has been debated for a very long time. And then we get to the third one, which is what is Zionism. Conflating all of these with Jewish identity. But this is precisely how Israeli propaganda functions, which is by conflating the identity with the particular national project and then the underlying philosophy of that project. Because Israel relies on Judaism being an ethno-nationalism, i.e. a nationalism that can justify a state based on a given ethnicity, in order to justify violence against the other ethnicity, Palestinians, Arabs, whatever, and conflating that violence as necessary of the ethno-nationalism that is built into, quote, Jewish identity. And then they build up anti-Semitism as the opposition of that if you disagree with any of these points it's anti-Semitic. That is why they bring in a genuine point of anti-Semitism, Jews control the government, with other things that they need people to believe to support them. It's a nasty trick and it's one of these classic things where if you just say things together enough, one becomes true if the other one becomes true, and they are extremely good at it. And we need to hit every single building block of that foundation to actually undermine it. Anti-Semitism is fucking real, but it is leveraged and promoted by Israel to justify mass violence against Palestinians.",

But it must be with the aim and in the context that works to push them away from that and towards, hmm, maybe, maybe it's not just bad that she was a white woman that killed maybe this is the point. Maybe I'm not safe anymore. Maybe I need to do more to defend myself and most importantly my neighbors that are actually at risk. Because I think there is a confusion on the leftist side that because the violence is getting more random, privilege will never protect you. That's not still true. You clearly can still receive protection from the regime as the iced terrorists do. You just need to give up more of your humanity. And so if you make that equation clear at the beginning, people won't fall into the side of giving up all of their humanity. And hopefully they will be mobilized more and more and more against them.",

    "text": "You may have heard of Panama in 1990 as a good example of American intervention. And they're vaguely right, which is that if you just look at the invasion of Panama, it did make them better. But that is like, but that is like looking at history just following October 7th, because history did not start in 1990, and the president that was replaced in that operation was put there by the CIA. So if your argument that American intervention is good when it ends American intervention, I'm in agreement there, my friend. But that does not support the claim that you're making, which is that American intervention, qua American intervention against a sovereign nation is ever good. It's an argument explicitly in favor of what I'm saying, which is America should fuck off on sovereign nations. So yes, look deeply and sincerely into American intervention from Indonesia to Brazil, get an overwhelming consensus on these leading to genocides, specifically Guatemala, the genocide of the Maya people, slaughters, and devastating times. And if you have one example, barring world war two, where it was a lot more complicated with involvement of the USSR, if you want to involve the USSR and our interventions, go find it. But if the only other example you have is a time where we ended intervention in a particularly violent way. Cool, welcome my friend to the anti-interventionist left, which by the way is where it starts.",

So here's how you use a whistle to help defend your community against ICE. First, you gotta make sure you have one. So look up Ice Distributions Around You. This will typically be through an immigrants coalition or an ice watch collective. They are in most cities. And the more people that have one, the stronger your community is. So bring your friends, bring your family, bring people you just met, and go get whistles. Then you gotta know how to use it. The purpose of the whistle is to notify people around you what's going on. It's three short quick bursts if ICE is in the area like this. And three long bursts if ICE is actively abducting someone like this. Obviously do them much louder because the purpose of this is to notify people so we can form a crowd and get loud because fascists don't like being observed, fascists don't like people exercising their right of free speech and free passage to check out what they're doing. And beyond that, record, record, record, don't publish the recordings without the consent of those recorded. Know your rights by checking out the website of your local immigrant coalition and specifically you can check out New York Immigration Coalition's pretty cohesive page. We're stronger together. This is a starting point because there are more of us than them and community is the cure to despair. So get organized. Arm your friends with knowledge, whistles, and whatever the fact I'll see can get them.",

It doesn't call for the return of Mitharo, which is an ongoing act of violence against Venezuela's sovereignty. All it does is prevent Trump from invading again, which means nothing when he already did so, captured their head of state, and kidnapped him. If you actually believe in restoring any semblance of America not just committing violence against anyone at once, the basic call is to return the kidnapped person, whether you think he's a private citizen or the actual head of state. If you don't even believe in that because you've been fucking brain-rotted by liberal propaganda about this, send an ICC. If you are liberal and think you pretend like international law exists, if you think America is anything other than an empire that commits violence against anyone that it wants to, which is what it is, but if you're deluding yourself, take that delusion fucking fully. And send him to the ICC because you know what the ICC is going to do? Send him back because he hasn't been fucking indicted. There is no position other than being a fascist who believes America can do what it wants, and being a communist who recognizes that that's exactly what America does, where you can actually justify or even understand logically what's going on. If you are a liberal or a neocon, this violates every world view you claim to hold, but that is because your position was made to be hypocritical, your position was made to be contradictory. You look at the violence of the empire, you pretend not to see it and you quail the very peak of it, but you don't do anything to undermine it.",

Very quickly, it comes from the breakup of Yugoslavia, where they broke up into a bunch of different countries, so Balkanization of the US is separation of the states, on a high or low scale. And you might ask, why does this have anything to do with what we're talking about now? I thought there was federal overreach. Well, Trump's USDA just suspended $120 million in federal funding to Minnesota in a clear retaliatory move against Governor Tim Walls. And this is perfectly expected considering fascism and fascism, but what this means is that we need to stop pretending like there was a cooperative relationship between the federal government where states can sway what the federal government does, but an antagonistic one. And if you are going to take seriously any of your constituents as a governor, as a representative, you need to start speaking in this language, I don't think you're actually going to be that effective. But if you're going to at least pretend to be effective in instrumentalizing the empire's structures, i.e. the states, to protect its citizens, if you're going to at least pretend to give a fuck you need to start talking about these, not as one in the same institutions whereas the state you work with in the federal government, but as an antagonistic one. How can California fight back against the fascist regime in DC? How can New York fight back against the fascist regime in DC? Not just when they come to New York, but organized. Because states, like it or not, have access to things that us as activists never will, they can organize healthcare. They have violence workers. They have institutional legitimacy as long as those institutions last and they got a shit ton of money. And so if we can't win over the federal government, which we won't, and we very likely won't have free and fair elections in the next five years, Republicans are already moving like there won't be. We must turn our aims towards separating the states away from the horrific federal government. I don't think we need to actually push it that much. I think it's going to happen anyway because Trump is pushing them away. We need to start acting as if they already are. This is more of a framework than a call to action. Consider how your state could separate. Consider which states you want to work with and start building those relationships organizationally, communitarianly, and effectively. Because if they cut these grants, people will starve. People will go broke. And it is not time to go beg the federal government for more money. It is time to take what we have and see how we can stop giving the federal government so much goddamn control.",

But when they do enacted political violence against political organizations, it is very often one of two groups of people.

The famous poem, of course, started with first they came for the communists. So even if you do not agree with communists, I don't know why, but even if you do not identify as a communist for whatever reason. Listen and take them at their word that they are most threatened by communists. So listen to communists when we're telling you what threatens them. It is not marches, it is not protests, it is not voting. They still allow you to vote so it actually doesn't attack them. It is very clearly militant, organized action. And I can't go in depth and explain every single way communists actually resist. I beg of you pick up a book and look at history that is not me being condescending, but that is because TikTok like controls what I can say. I post this because if you are genuinely interested in undermining fascists, they know what undermines them. And they know the narratives they have to spread to stop you from listening to the people that undermine them.",

    "text": "They didn't tell you to listen to the Palestinian diaspora, why are they telling you to listen to the Iranian diaspora? Why do they tell you to listen to the Venezuelan and Cuban diaspora's but deport the Nicaraguan Guatemala and El Salvadorian diaspora? It's because central is that they don't care what the diaspora think. They support the American Empire. And the fact is that most Iranians don't support American intervention. The fact is most Venezuelans didn't support American intervention. But that doesn't actually matter because they are leveraging the diaspora, the portion of the diaspora and the way they can force the diaspora to be, to do what they want to do anyway. And the contradictions are obvious if you look. Because if we really gave a fuck about intervention on the basis of who it is affecting, we would have never supported invading Gaza? Because almost 100% of gossips don't support it? But it's not because we never actually invade to engage in self-determination. That's why we support dictators in Saudi Arabia and in Jordan. That's why we installed dictators in Indonesia and Brazil and Chile. It's not for self-determination and diaspora politics is hard. Determining what people actually want and how to engage with that productively is very difficult. That's what's central to leftist politics. That's why it's very hard when we see someone weaponizing it in a deeply unnewanced way to just in the exact same way rejected. That will lead to equally unhelpful politics. So when engaging with this, you must at the center realize they don't give a fuck. They don't care what Iranians want because what they want for Iran is not best for Iran. And we know this because America's intervened in Iran before, not for democracy but against democracy when we depose Mosedek. We don't give a fuck what's best for Iraqis we killed to 6 million of them. We can have discussions about how to actually best engage in democracy. How to actually with all the power that America unjustfiedly has best enable self-determination. But if that results in you leveraging the exact same tools, exact same rhetoric and exact same weapons of the American empire to that inflicted these horrible dictatorships, these horrible regimes, these horrible atrocities, you aren't trying to help. You're trying to enable it. You're trying to profit off of it.",

    "text": "The first bullet will not be for the black man, but for the white trader that sold out his people. That is a quote often attributed to this man, a well-known white supremacist terrorist in South Africa, aiming to maintain the apartheid system. So while the attribution is quite frankly very difficult to find, and it doesn't directly literally apply because bullets have been flying in America the past 250 years against black and brown people, the sentiment is very clear, which is that while white supremacists, especially those that identified theorize as such, maintain hatred and what separation or oppression of those they see to be racially inferior, their primary immediate political targets are those they deem to be white traders. Because in white supremacist minds, and in fact white supremacist societies like America and South Africa, white people hold the power. And the most important thing for a white supremacist is to maintain the solidarity of those that hold power, the elites understand us, that is why rich people have solidarity amongst themselves, and they are willing to enforce the solidarity with violence, that is what is being seen. It is not just an expansion of the stochastically violent terrorist put on the street, but it is a part and an effect of those terrorists being hired by the state, those violence workers, that organization being penetrated actively, so by white supremacist organizations like the Proud Boys, like Identity Europa, like Christian Identity, and like the KKK. Whose primary call to action is not to enforce racial separation, that was there like 60 years ago, 70 years ago, they will leave that to the system they want to change. Their primary immediate call to action as a small group of privileged and very violent individuals is to start enforcing the solidarity amongst white people, so that we have their stand in line while they shift the system to be more openly, oppressive, more openly violent, and more openly racialized, or we see ourselves as next. So if you don't want to stand in line, if you don't want to fall in line with the white supremacist terrorists, you better start identifying a hell of a lot more with those oppressed by the white supremacy, those oppressed by the racial superiority, those oppressed by the American Empire, then focusing on maintaining the privilege that they grant you. And that is the shift, because you genuinely will become a race trader, and that is not a slur, that is a fucking compliment, because anything other than a race trader and a white supremacist society is a white supremacist.",

He didn't do it the way it was meant to be done. But what comes next is very likely resembling it, which is faking a coup to establish another coup. He didn't do that well, but then mass liquidation of dissidents. And even the New York Times, the imperial mouthpiece, is reporting that repression has intensified. And this is exactly what happened in Indonesia. In Chile, in Argentina, in the Karagua, Guatemala, Honduras, it is not just that America is incompetent. It is that America knows precisely what they're doing and they never went in there to benefit the Venezuelan people. They never went in there to benefit the Brazilian people. They never went in there to benefit the Indonesian people. They went in there to make a weaker regime to serve their interests. And so you can have all the opinions you'd like. You can have all the introduction, all the condemnation of a previous or other regime as you'd like. But if that ends in suggesting that we do the one thing we know that habitually makes human rights worse, which is American intervention, this is not just a prediction we're seeing it happen in real time.

First, you gotta find people to do shit with that are down to do shit. This can be your neighborhood, this can be your tenants union, and this can be a party. There's almost certainly already a community defense organization in your area, if you live in a major metro area, find them, join them, and talk to your neighbors about joining them. Second of all, Mutual Aid. Think about what happens if one of your neighbors gets kidnapped. Who helps? Who do they call? Who needs help? Build those connections now, talk to your neighbors, talk to your community, put together a plan, put together an ice watch, because we are stronger together. The first move is not go make yourself stronger. The first move is go make your community stronger, three direct action. Once you have people that will work with you to defend you, work with you if they come after you, find actions that effectively work. The best way to go and see what is effective is go and see what people that are more seasoned are already doing. What did they do to slow down ice in Chicago? What did they do to slow down ice and DHS in Portland? If you can't do direct action, how can you support people that are doing that? Do you know who is doing it? Do you know what their demands are? Think global, act local. Think globally. We are trying to undermine a national and imperial fascist authoritarian state. But the action, as we have demonstrated, will always be local. You cannot defend someone halfway across the country from being shot by ice, but you can damn well defend your neighbor. So the most impactful action you can do is making your community more resilient, more militant, and more effective at undermining this regime.",

    "text": "America has never wanted democracy in Iran. Because in 1953 America and England overthrew Iran's popular and democratically elected leader, Mosadeg. Here's a good article explaining it, how we explicitly undermine at every single step democracy in Iran. Primarily because Mosadeg dared nationalize oil that Britain thought was their own, it just happened to be an Iranian ground. This is not a conspiracy theory, the CIA has confirmed their involvement. And following this, the CIA trained and helped fund the Savak, the extremely brutal and brutalistic secret police of the Shah, the unelected monarch of Iran. Once again, you can read this directly on the CIA's website. Deposing this autocratic and brutal leader is what led to the 1979 Islamic Revolution, which installed the current style of government in Iran. So if you are now calling for American intervention into Iran, you don't know your history. America has no interest in democracy in Iran, just as we have no interest in Iraq, no matter how brutal Saddam Hussein's regime was. So I'm begging you, before a multi-billion dollar propaganda machine is targeted directly at the American populist to manufacture consent for invasion or bombing or intervention into Iran learn the history. If you can name to me the current governments of Iran, if you could name to me the history of Iran, I will respect the opinion. But until then, which the vast majority of the American public does not have, we should not be even vaguely discussing intervention. It is not our right, it is not our rule, and it will not help anyone. Almost every single regime America has ever installed in another country from Brazil to Chile to Nicaragua to Guatemala, has led to genocide, led to brutality, and led to mass slaughtering. That is not an accident, that is not me being a critical radical lefty, that is documented as part of the strategy, and I beg of you to learn about it.",

Even if the individual case might be, the system was set up that this was inevitable. Violence is going to be committed by well-armed fascists aimed at ethnic cleansing, and that is what ice is. So if you want to work against them, you have to meet the threat where they are, which is an actively militant, actively violent, and randomly violent group, intent on disappearing, brutalizing, or murdering, all people that stand in their way. And the only way to defend against that is not peaceful marches, not peaceful parades, and not organizing within the electoral system that funded this. But it is starting by organizing your community to be effective in defense, and then be effective in direct action against such illegal, harmful, disgusting, and militant actions. So I cannot urge you enough to go see what is in your area. Someone is already working on this. There are already people concerned on this, and it is very likely the people that are most effective. And if you can help them, that is the most effective thing you can do. Not another parade, not another march, not another door marking. That is great. That builds awareness, but people are aware. The next step is action. So for example, in Charlotte, we have people's defense. We have tenants unions that are doing effective, strategic, and militant organizing. We have ice watch, and we have no your rights trainings. These are led by the community's most effective, and they are not concerned with what the Gestapo think shouldn't be done to them. This is the only thing they listen to, so make sure they hear you.",

But so does every single one of these? And every single one of these because this violence is not new, it's just more explicit. We risk losing sight of helpful systemic analysis when we focus on the utter horror of an individual because the sad truth is that is what he was hired to do. That was not a mistake. That was not a lack of training. That was not an overreaction. That was his job. The problem is the job. The problem is the system that paid him and hired him and brought him into one of the largest terrorist groups in the world, the American justice system. Second only to the American Department of War. So yes, call for his arrest. Call for justice. Call for some semblance of justice that we can provide to this victim of ice. But we must work as hard and as quickly and as militantly to provide the only justice that is an option for all of the victims of ice from those illegally brutally deported to those illegally brutally are detained to those that were murdered, which is the abolition of the violent state that murdered them.",

From South American leaders that did minor land reform while appealing to America, communists, African leaders that literally cited revolutionary American texts, communists. Any country or leader or people or group that didn't swear full fledged allegiance to America in the 70s, 80s and 90s, communists, and you know what it didn't produce? A bunch of principled communists, because that's not actually how it works. What is happening is fascists who want to be fascists who already have every reason to be fascists, but feel like it's not okay or looking for an excuse, and they are threatening with you. It is the same thing as rich people saying, I'm just gonna leave if taxes go up. It is a threat with the power they have, but it's not actually a natural conclusion and it's not actually what we see. So stop this. Call someone a fascist if they're a fascist. Call someone a communist if they're a communist. I'm a communist. But don't pretend like labeling you accurately is any more violent than the ideology you actually hold.",

And that's because they're not saying things because they believe them to be true, they're saying them because they're helpful, look at this. This is paid propaganda's Cam Higby, and this is his full take. On Twitter, it goes on for a truly ridiculous amount of time. And if it was a clear cut case of self-defense, as they claim it was, this would not be the response. This response shows one thing, which is that there are poor and lies about it already distraction. They're not saying them because they're true, and we know that because the narrative changes every single time we speak to them, and it doesn't have to be true to be effective. They don't want to convince you that it wasn't a murder. They want to distract you who know it was a murder, and galvanize their base. And there's nothing you can do to de-galvanize their base. There's no amount of facts that you can change someone's mind, whose mind was not made up by facts. But you do choose how you react to their abhorrent speech. And yes, we should undermine fascists. I mean, there is a discussion we had with how to engage with them. But the first and foremost call to action is not to correct the fascists that want to distract us. But to organize against the fascist violence they are aiming to enable. And what that looks like, right now, what you can do is look up community organizations that are doing community defense in your area. Look up where there is a nice watch, look up where there is a mutual aid organization. Find people and communities that want to militantly and effectively defend their neighbors. Because fighting people on Twitter, however righteous that is, will not respect the memory of all that ICE has murdered and disappeared and brutalized more than actually organizing to prevent it.",

Grab a drink because there is a lot but stick with me because it is so interesting how they work. Here is Xavier, a preger you contributor saying black and Jewish people have more in common than you think. Here is an Arab Muslim living in Israel. Here is a gay guy going around and asking queer people out their opinions on Palestine. And here is a Hindu nationalist saying Hindus and Jews have more in common than they think. And finally here is a Venezuelan socialism survivor telling people a bad socialism is. Well I'll tell you all of them are published on this Israeli propaganda page street smart. And it is a master class in how to leverage diasporas and elite captured identity politics to push far right wing propaganda. So let's look back at what we saw. This is Xavier, a gay black guy paid by oil oligarchs to push far right wing narratives. This collab ends in them suggesting that the oppression is railies face in Israel because of Palestinians defending themselves is comparable to the oppression that black people face in America. This one erases the apartheid that Arabs have reported consistently to human rights groups in Israel for the past 70 years. This one engages in rainbow washing where they claim bigotedly that Palestinians and Arabs are habitually more homophobic than for example Israelis where gay marriage is illegal. And it repeats homophobic and racist tropes such as throwing gay people off buildings. This one she is a Hindu nationalist, Hondurta, a far right wing vitriolic ethno nationalist ideology that does have a lot in common with Zionism but not Judaism. And this final one the Venezuelan socialist survivor works at the Manhattan Institute and the young America's fellowship. Manhattan Institute a right wing libertarian think tank and the YAF and explicitly libertarian neocon think tank. But the trick they are using is cherry picking people from the diaspora or direct community they want to represent that they either pay or happen to agree with them. And not a single one of those individuals is representative of either the community or the diaspora abroad with Arabs in Israel by and large reporting some form of prosecution. The black people in America by and large reporting some form of experience racism but they are able to find movements and schisms within these communities that they benefit from and then paint a monolithic picture of those communities in a way that liberals cannot fight because they are not actually interested in those individuals. They are interested in monolithic understandings of their identities and if we as the left want to undermine and attack this form of propaganda we need to engage within diasporas and individual communities better. We need to understand the context of how Hondurta interacts with other nationalist groups across the world like Israeli nationalism. So when they tell you to listen to Hindu voices you go why those ones when they tell you to listen to black voices you go why ones paid by oilbearance.",

So as it ramps up, which it will, and it hits people that previously did not experience violence in the American regime, you will hear a lot. We do not have time for Palestine, we do not have time for Syria. Those people do not want to undermine the fascist violence, literally tearing at their door, they want to change who it affects.",

And I really want to make sure that you guys understand that these ICE agents are being trained to use the same exact tactics that the Israeli occupation forces use against Palestinians in the West Bank. This is all related and everybody who keeps on saying that Israel is not our problem. We don't have to focus on Israel. We have to focus on us here at home. You're ignoring the fact that Israel is the reason that we are facing such violence here at home at the hands of these ICE agents. So as shoot now, ask questions later. And already the government is trying to act like ICE was acting in self-defense. What we're experiencing is something called the Imperial Boomerang, where violence and aggression is tested on people overseas to eventually end up coming back here to use against our own citizens. From the Israeli military to ICE to local police departments, it's all the same thing. It's about how these governments can use violence and fear against a group of people fighting against whatever the government wants. I think a lot of people scoff at the thought of having to care about things like international law and foreign policy. But what it all comes down to is just holding politicians and governments accountable. And we need to hold the governments accountable for the evils that they are doing because when we don't hold them accountable for what they do over there, we're not going to be able to hold them accountable for what they do over here. It's all linked. Please recognize that if you're upset about how ICE agents are treating people here in the United States, it's literally because we told the government that we don't care when the government does that to other people. And now it's just coming right back at us.",

Yes, the ICE agents are entrained, but that is intentional because they're training what they're meant to do, which is inflict violence against those that stop them. And DHS is already trying to justify it off of self-defense, but it is not an over-response. That is not the liberal position. It was an intentional slaughter of an activist to prove a point. Do not leave out the political context of this violence because that is essential. It is tragic a life was lost that is central as well, but we cannot strip this of the political intention of the violators, of the oppressors, because the intention is to send a message to activists that you could be next. And they are right. You could be next. You have to take them at their word and act like it. Act like every life that has lost because of the American fascist regime. To Venezuela, to Palestine, to Libya is your own. The second you became politically activated was the best time, but now is the second best time. So take them at their word. You're going to be next.

If they think it's a mistake, why are liberals and conservatives lying about it? Why did they lie about the murders that happened prior to this? Why did they lie about the legality of it?

This officer tries an illegal seizure, he positions himself in front of the car and then shoots the person. And according to the best data we have, this is the man that pulled the trigger. So in the coming days where every media source from liberal to conservative, under react to this clear state terrorist murder, I want you to remember, in your mind, there is no world in which this is self-defense. Bullets don't stop cars, that person wasn't going to be run over and didn't believe he was and he positioned himself in front of the car, explicitly placing himself at risk and the other person was enacting a violation of the now murdered person's rights. Us enacting her rights is self-defense, keep that central and the imperial slop will not work. And second of all, you will see the person maligned as a state terrorist, anyone that disagrees with the Trump regime or previously the liberal and democratic regimes can be labeled a state terrorist. Because a state terrorist is merely someone the regime does not like. It is a meaningless term that even in the world where we do have laws must be tried. Do not fall for imperial slop justifying the murder of a protester because that protester could and will be you. And importantly do not merely highlight that they were a peaceful protester because peaceful protest will never undermine a militia actively intent on killing, brutalizing or oppressing anyone that is working against their aims, which is what ice a domestic terrorist organization is. They were trained by foreign terrorist organizations in the IDF and they brought those home to oppress you. So don't fall for it, don't support it and start working militantly and effectively against it.",

America's historical best allies was the elite of people in Eastern Europe or Russia who were harmed by communist policies and we could take and use as propaganda machines. And that's not just me. This is a well-documented phenomena of instrumentalizing a diaspora to a particular political goal. Because in fact, a majority of people in formerly communist nations actually think life was better under communism. But if you go and ask that diaspora, especially Yofr spring of that diaspora, they'll say, my grandfather hated it. My grandfather's property got stolen. My grandfather starved under communism. And I actually don't doubt that that's true. But it is a product of a very intentional effort by the American Empire to only take in, at least within the first wave, and when they had control over it, asylum seekers and refugees that represented a political aim. And this is re-created across the board. From how we represent African women, especially escaping Africa, that's what that article was about, to paint Africans back home as classic racial stereotypes of animalized and vile. And once again, the stories of those women are probably true, and I'm not meaning to demean that. But I am saying they are true within a particular context, and they are being brought for a reason other than being true, but because they are helpful. And it is important that this is not universal. It is not always true that everyone was taken in bad faith. But when you are considering, just listen to insert group that we want to invade next. You must begin with an understanding of why those people are here. And if there's a power dynamic that was inherited from the place they fled. And if that is different from first to second to third wave. Because many of the staunchest anti-communist people in America were Cuban refugees or Polish refugees. But their children, or their children's children, who grew up around the horrors of late stage capitalism and capitalism in general in its form of imperialism are different and have a particular interesting context that while not representative of those truths is representative of something significant. While understanding the instrumentalization of someone's experiences feels icky, right, because we want to meet the person that we're speaking to in front, if we don't understand this game and engage with it in a human moral way, we are allowing the right wing to win on it. We cannot afford to allow the right wing to take over identity politics. Because that will mean they bring in the people that benefit them in harming everyone else.",

Then at least give him to the ICC because there is no world, there is no vision where America has any right to attack a sovereign legal or illegal bad or good of another sovereign nation and persecute him in a domestic court. No one agrees with that. Even America's conception of international law, even the Empire's self-conception doesn't think that. So there is no world, I get why America doesn't because they want power. But why do you have to be a tool of that? If you are falling for the liberal propaganda that there is any international law right now, at the very least, stick by your guns and say, okay, maybe I don't believe we should send Maduro back to Venezuela, we should certainly send him to the ICC, though. And by the way, you know what the ICC is going to do. Send him to Venezuela because that's actually how the international law works. But my mind will never wrap around the level of boot lickingness that you must do to say, sure, maybe I don't agree with, you know, Trump invading a sovereign nation and kidnapping their leader. But am I going to do anything about it? No. Eh, I don't really care. And even that most people didn't vote for Trump. Maduro has actually about the same approval rating as Joe Biden did. Should England invade America and steal Joe Biden? No, Joe Biden, by the way, through his funding of Gaza, killed more people. Like, you don't have to believe he's perfect, you don't have to believe he's good. But for the love of fucking God, can you stop being American exceptions for about two seconds?",

    "text": "Trump is invading like a fascist, not a liberal, let me explain. Liberals, in the Iraq war, in the Iran-Araq conflict, in the Korean War and the Vietnamese war, they lie. They lie out their ass, weapons of mass destruction, the Tonkin affair. That is because liberals are the ideology that support capitalism, but not admit its more gross aspects. And the grossest aspect of capitalism is when it naturally does imperialism, which is just the expanse of the monopolies of capital. Bashism, on the other hand, finds pride and joy in the nasty bits of capitalism, the exclusion, the elitism. It justifies and galvanizes on the basis of that. Because what it does is it widens the elite class on arbitrary boundaries. Instead of the elite being the billionaires, right, which we just ignore exist, the elites become heritage Americans. That new identifying term for white supremacists. But when you see invasions saying, I'm doing this for America, I'm going to steal their oil. Suddenly that ethno-nationalism is galvanizing rather than disgusting. If George Dobie Bush came out and verbatim said that he was doing this for white people, that probably would turn off some liberals. But if he said that he was doing it for all people, that's different. Trump's not even pretending to do that. I mean, he has some sprinkles here and there, and he's doing it for the Venezuela's, but with Greenland, he's openly not. He's doing it for the benefit of Americans. And that is because fascists are galvanized by ethno-nationalism, fascists are galvanized by the violence of imperialism. Liberals hide from it, lie about it, and ignore it, and are supported by the profits of it. That's the difference. It's a different type of violence and it's a different flavor of violence. And I think that announces this is helpful in contextualizing it. And it also avoids this nonsense that this is somehow super new.",

I would love to leave America, but America will refuse to leave me alone. Me leaving America doesn't prevent America from bombing whatever country I end up in. It doesn't prevent the many people it will bomb anyway, and it certainly doesn't help the people that I'm trying to protect from the American Empire. This discussion is always so weird, because the person commenting this almost certainly doesn't actually benefit from the American imperialism, which almost uniquely benefits the top 1% that will just steal billions of oil profits from either Venezuela or now they're looking at Greenland. This isn't a matter of me like wanting every American citizen to be horrible and die. I want every American citizen to succeed, and that is an opposition to what you are referring to as America, because the America you're referring to is the American Empire leaching off of its citizens, and leaching off of the global south and the third world. So I am just begging America to leave everyone else alone. That's why I'm anti-American.",

Because the center of liberal and fascist politics will always be imperialism, because that is the highest form of capitalism. Fascism, of course, being imperialism, come in on itself, liberalism being imperialism, only abroad. And if leftists don't learn from the imperial violence that we do abroad from Palestine to Libya to Iraq, then not only will we be ill prepared when it comes home as we have been in the form of ice being trained by the IDF, in the form of Palantir being trained on Palestinian faces. But we will also be ill equipped to recognize the new and ever evolving methods and narratives that the imperialists make up to justify their conquest and violence as we have seen in Venezuela. And now as we are seeing with that Nazi Stephen Miller talking about Greenland, or talking about Cuba, or talking about Colombia, they are ever fluid in how they frame, reframe, contextualize and justify their imperialism, but they have never been clear about the aim which is to extract billions from the periphery of the empire. And so if you have ever conceived of yourself as anything other, then a white settler on stolen land. The first step is to stop being that. And that includes not expanding the colony any further, and if you don't think you are just as bad as the people that took and slaughtered from the natives, then it starts with stopping the exact same mechanisms slaughtering people in the exact same places.",

And that is why the left needs to get much better at diaspora politics, the politics of that diaspora. And as I've said, the right has a home field advantage because they've got the trap set. That's why this is already so difficult because the Iranians, Venezuelans, Cubans, etc. that we will largely have access to are disproportionately in support of regime change. And that is a choice. That is a choice that the American empire did by choosing who comes in. That's largely true of the first wave, non-isture of later waves, but still generally, an effect on the population. And it is very hard to undermine that, even instead of building in a better, effective, and counter narrative about diasporas and about how to actually engage them politically as we have, for example, the pro-Palestinian movement, or pushing for refugee status for Syrians, we simply reject diasporas as a whole, which I have been guilty of at points in my life. And my proposal, as it has always been, is to build an effective leftist model. Think about how to engage with the new generation of Iranians that recognize the harm of American imperialism while experiencing at times harms of the consequent regimes of American imperialism. How do you engage with people who grew up with their grandfather telling them how evil communism is while they literally with their eyes saw how evil America was? There is a way to do this, and it is necessary if we want to ground our politics in anti-imperialism, we cannot circle jerk as white American leftists without engaging with the people from the global self that we actually have access to. But we also cannot have that co-opted by the right wing to push interventionist and paternalistic narratives. So this is mainly a call to action for thinking about it, engaging with it, talking about it amongst each other. There's lots of theory on this issue. I readily capture. There's also a lot of post-colonial theory. But I bring this up because Venezuela is a clear example of this, where there is a clear difference between the diaspora and the in-country peoples, especially on the position of Western imperialism and American intervention. And the calls to listen to Venezuelans always leaves out the Venezuelans in the country. Or the Venezuelans in the country are lied about. When, from our best data, we know a majority of them don't support American intervention. But we cannot successfully defend against that, if we don't actually have better effective communities, narratives, and models. Because the right wing has a multi-billion dollar model of this. We got nothing.",

You don't go, no, I guess not, but like Saddam Hussein really was evil. No, because you recognize it was never about that. America doesn't care if a leader is evil or democratically elected. America installed Saddam Hussein to benefit our aims, and then when he did it, we did a huge slander campaign against him. And this could be hit on all different sides, right? But I have no interest in every five to ten years walking you through the different mechanisms of the American Imperial propaganda machine. If you can't learn from when we did that already, you probably don't believe that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Why the fuck would you believe whatever the fuck comes out of the American mainstream media about a noble global South country? You probably agree that invasion and undermining of the political integrity of Iraq or Libya was harmful to the people that lived there. Why would you have any tolerance for us doing it now? And for the love of God, you probably agree that everyone that spent all their time talking about weapons of mass destruction on purely CIA information were not helping anyone. The liberals that took a middle ground, moderate approach, asking George W. Bush to just bomb few early rocky children, helped no one, and we all universally respect the one representatives that voted against it. So why are you not doing that now? Why are you not learning from Guatemala? Why are you not learning from Honduras? Why are you not learning from Nicaragua? Why are you not learning from Libya? Why are you not learning from Iraq?

And you are doing something just as harmful if not systemically worse. And not only are you a hypocrite, but you also lose the standing to critique any other third world country who is doing something that inevitably actually kills fewer people. Like just because you don't see it and because it's not in your country, America using imperial power to force other trading partners to not trade with Venezuela or not trade with Cuba does actually kill more people than any of the accusations that you have against these leaders. That is more authoritarian. That also restricts democracy more when there is a foreign power using a billion dollar industry trillion dollar at this point to sway the quote unquote democracies.

From Syrian Christians spreading vitriolic Islamophobia, to Iranian spreading vitriolic Islamophobia and American intervention, to now loud Venezuelan and Cuban diasporas being used to justify American intervention, or even how the Israeli propaganda machine uses Hindu Tva, Indian diaspora members, to push nationalist and ethnocentric views. The right has a masterclass in this and they have a advantage. Because of the right wing's control on immigration into America, they've been able to hand pick how and who gets into America. A phenomenon that was shaped by the asylum system in Cold War, very well summarized here, explaining how we used refugees from Eastern Europe to push anti-communist lines. So they have a home-grown advantage, having built and set up the system with America's asylum and immigration system being very racist and very classist. But the left should not be hopeless. And I at times have been guilty of this as well. Simply rejecting diasporas on the basis of the home-grown advantage the right wing has. But that is wrong and that is not helpful. Because that is very true of first wave generations of immigrants, but it is not universal. Some of the most effective activists we have seen in our time, including the Palestinian movement mainly led by people of the Palestinian diaspora, has centered diasporatic members because they're specialized knowledge, fundamental trust on the issue, and familial ties into the issue. Many people in a diaspora are right to be effective activists, revolutionaries, even within the imperial core. And I can't describe like a whole theory of inclusion and theoretical political model of all diasporas. But what I am saying is we must be able to build up a better model of diasporatic action than the right wing has. Because for them, it's a multi-billion dollar industry that many people's aunts, uncles, cousins rely on to get into America following the first wave. And if we don't build a different better model of incorporated and understanding people who are members of the diaspora, then we will see time and time and time again what we have seen with the invasion of Venezuela, which is them leveraging very effectively the Venezuelan diaspora with no effective, concerted, unified messaging to the opposite, other than ignore Venezuelans, which I've seen from some and been disappointed in.

    "text": "Return Maduro to Venezuela. That is the call. And if you're not calling that, you don't actually condemn Trump's illegal actions. You don't actually condemn America's illegal actions. Because if you think it was illegal, the first step is to do reparations. And the starting point for reparations of a kidnapping is returning the kidnapped person. And if you really want to live out, don't just return him to Venezuela, send him to the ICC, send him to the Hague. And you know what they're going to do? Return him to Venezuela, as is his right, as a sovereign who hasn't even been charged by the International Court. Who, by the way, does still have jurisdiction over Maduro because they haven't completed their her succession and has actually charged, you know who? Benjamin Netanyahu, who came to America and was not sent. So this especially goes out to the two things can be true at once, crowd. You can believe all of the American propaganda on Maduro and you can believe some of the truth of the harm that he's caused. But if you sincerely believe both things, you have to take at least one seriously, which is that if what was done was illegal, the consequence of a crime is reparation. You cannot say it was illegal and wrong and bad and atrocious and then say we should continue doing it by holding him. Every second we hold him, we commit a crime. So if you want to pretend we're living in a rules-based order which is the fantasy world that liberals live in, you got to pretend a little harder. And that includes saying every second we're committing a crime. So if you're part of the two things can be true at once, crowd, the consequence of that is your call shouldn't end with condemning Trump which is very politically expedient for the liberals that just want you to vote more, but to call to return Maduro. If you actually believe in rules, follow them. But you don't, because you don't actually believe in the system that you're appealing to. You don't actually believe the system you hold third world leaders to, how you condemn Maduro, how you condemn every third world leader on the basis of human rights, on the basis of violating political integrity. You use it when it's helpful to you to condemn Trump, to condemn third world leaders, but you don't hold the consequence of it, which is that America and the American Empire is the largest criminal in human history. Now to be extremely clear, I don't believe in America intervening at all in South America ever regardless of how brutal or not brutal a given leader is. That is not the discussion. So if a bunch of bots are in my comments saying don't you understand how horrible Maduro is, they didn't watch the whole video and call him out for that. And that mainly comes from a position of no one ever being as brutal as America is every single day. From Iraq to Palestine to Libya, we slaughter more than any apparent dictator could. So we have no fucking right ever to intervene or judge another country's actions.",

After the US dropped atomic bombs on Japan, did you see any Japanese people bombing American cities? No, but the occupation ended and there were international trials for war crimes. The Holocaust, the Jews go around attacking random Germans? What a- No, but the regime fell and was occupied. And there was an international trial for war crimes. About the Tutsis after the Rwandan genocide. Nope, but the regime fell and there was an international tribunal. South Africans after the apartheid. Tribunal, regime fall. Armenians after the Turks slaughtered them. Or you've none of them went out and murdered innocent civilians too. I mean, innocent civilians did die during Operation Nemesis. You don't know what you're talking about. Resist. They rebuilt. They saw justice. They moved forward. You see real strength is breaking the cycle. Not repeating it. You ignore how they sought peace. You ignore how they reached justice. It wasn't just through like forgetting the violence that was committed against them. It was through going through an effective process from punitive to restorative justice and paying reparations and ending the occupation. Which is real right now. Today has the option to do. But you are ignoring that and calling on the Palestinians to move on when not a single one of the groups that you named actually did that without a restorative justice process. What gaslighting nonsense. But of course it is. It's Zionist propaganda. It's not meant to be true. It's meant to be confusing.",

And this moralization on consumer spending and paying back loans while we never moralize about corporations in the public sphere, pulling literally billions out of our economy in corporate profits and stock buybacks is literally just the product of multiple billions of dollars spent on corporate propaganda convincing us that the consumer and the poor people are the problem not the very wealthy actually in charge.

You can have issues with the previous regime, but the Venezuelan people are the people that determine that, not the invading, occupying America, which is explicitly aiming to steal billions from Venezuelans. If this was about a corrupt regime, replace it with an international coalition.

    "text": "In 1954, America bombed and cood a democratically elected leader in Guatemala. America then helped install and maintain an autocratic regime that slaughtered thousands of Guatemalans. America claimed that the previous leader was a communist dictator, abusing its people and working with the USSR to be a threat to America. But internal CIA documents demonstrated that America did not believe that. They were aware that they were democratically elected. They were aware that they were treating human rights with respect. And they were perfectly aware that there was no real USSR threat through Guatemala. What actually angered the American empire to the point of bombing and cooing a democratically elected leader was that that leader was implementing land reforms that harmed an American corporation. That ended that practice of the American corporation engaged in explicit slave labor, at least to some extent. Once again, this man was not a communist. Now history does not repeat, but from Argentina to Chile to Brazil, to Guatemala, to Nicaragua, to Honduras, it does damn rhyme, especially when the exact same big bad guy is acting. Because America is not that clever. And so if you hear pretty much all the exact same shit from all the exact same person, you can assume they're doing it for the same reasons. Now the facts of this particular regime or this particular government may differ, but America doesn't care and you can believe that because America didn't care when an autocratic leader ran Guatemala. They cared that that autocratic leader served American corporate interests.",

    "text": "America knows how to cue a small nation. It's called the Jakarta method, but Trump's not doing it well. So very quickly, the Jakarta method, named for its namesake in Jakarta and Donisia, goes something like this. Fake or create a left-wing coup, do a much more powerful right-wing coup to counter it, and then that right-wing coup implements a dictator and implements martial law to defend from the communists. It almost always coincides with billions of natural resources being opened up to foreign investment, and after years of anti-communist propaganda against whatever regime they wanted to topple. So we see elements of this in Venezuela, anti-communist propaganda, American backed and supported unpopular resistance, and if they're successful, what's likely to come next, which is the implementation of authoritarian dictator, that will open up to foreign investment, another major feature of even America's rhetoric about this. But what's important to note is Trump's doing this poorly. Not only is he not rejecting that the coup was his own, like we did in Jakarta, like we did in Brazil, like we did in Chile, but he's openly making the connection between the coup and foreign investment, with only a veneer of pretending like it's about human rights. And he has verbatim said that America will run Venezuela, something we never said about Brazil or Chile or Argentina. And it's hard to say exactly what this means, but here's my theory. Trump doesn't get the game. He is a fascist and fascists are proud of their imperial aims. Neo liberals want it because their corporate overlords want it, but they are ashamed because they want to hide it because that's how you get away with it. And what supports this theory is that liberals are not necessarily mad that Trump removed a sovereign leader of a effectively sovereign country, or that he violated the quote-unquote rules-based order that America is meant to be on. They're mad that he didn't get congressional approval to do it. They're mad that he's admitting what it is about. They're mad that he's doing it so openly and brutally, not that he's doing it. And the difference between those two things is leftists are mad because it violates sovereignty and engages in American imperialism. Liberals are mad because he's not hiding the American imperialism. So if you know any amount of history from any of this, this is both perfectly expected and also mildly surprising. But it shouldn't be if you know how fascist-do-imperialism, which is that they don't even hide it.",

You must always ask which, because the ones that are in America are in America for a reason. And that's not cynical or undermining. That is a fact of American power. Is that we only accept immigrants and diasporas, at least in the first wave, that are serving our aims. We saw this explicitly happen with Cuba, where we brought in a bunch of Cuban immigrants that are now not welcome, who had their plantations and their slave plantations and their palaces stolen by the communist regime. We took in many Iranians who were of the upper class of Iran, and you can tell that because they still support the Shaw, the monarch of Iran. And now we are seeing it play out very extensively with Venezuela, where it is not all selection bias, and there is some discussion to be had. But the overwhelming force and the political instrumentalization of this diaspora is not an accident, but it is a feature. So yes, you should center the people that are most affected, but the fact is most Cubans, Venezuelans, and Iranians do not support American intervention. So don't allow this correct maximum of centering those that are affected, to be centering those that are affected that you have access to, because America has control of who is affected and who have access to. And if you aren't cynically considering why and how they're making that decision of who you have access to, you're not doing the people that are affected any good. And if you're interested in more cohesive explanation of how identity politics was captured by the elite, here's the book Elite Capture.",

And today proves that even further. After America illegally bombing Syria, Palestine, and Nigeria through it or its proxies, America illegally invaded Venezuela. And liberals are not decrying the fact that we are going to replace Maduro with a fascist, which is going to be what happens considering any amount of historical knowledge. Ever, they are decrying that liberals weren't given the opportunity to sign off on this, like they were with all the other sanctions that we have put on Venezuela that have slaughtered thousands. There is no debate, internal of the American Empire, whether we should be a terrorist. The debate is always how we should, and the biggest faux pas that Trump has done today is just admit it.",

But the speed with which this is happening makes that inevitable and that is intentional. They are engaged in blitzkrieg. They are trying to make it so quick that not only the people that are being invaded and attacked cannot conceivably respond with the scale and speed with which they are being invaded, but also the democratic feedback mechanisms in the American Empire cannot respond. As long as they have even a slight grasp over the propaganda mechanism that is the Washington Post, New York Times, Fox News, and CNN, they can slow down their response to their atrocities such that they can just move on to a next one. And that is why I do not spend time debating whether we should have taken out Maduro. Obviously, it is not America's responsibility to go in and judge which leaders should be in charge. We pick bad ones that murder millions across Brazil, Peru, Argentina, and Chile. We have blood on our hands. We are supporting currently despots in Jordan and Saudi Arabia that are slaughtering people. And that is because these talking points from oil and Venezuela to Maduro to human rights, etc are not in good faith and not to be engaged with. They are trying to distract until they can move on and bomb another place. It doesn't matter if he vaguely had a legal right to do it because he doesn't care if he had a legal right to do it. We must right now effectively and militantly work against the American Empire in all of its forms. Not debate what the empire can and can't do. The empire cannot exist as an empire.",

The issue with the terrorist attack that America just inflicted upon Venezuela and kidnapped their president was not that Congress of the American Empire didn't tell the current regime leader of the American Empire that it was okay. The problem was that it was regime change of a sovereign country to steal billions of dollars worth of oil from said country after sanctioning and slaughtering thousands of its citizens every year for the past 20 years. That's the problem. And the people focusing on the fact that he didn't slaughter these people with congressional approval are fucking just as complicit that is fucking insane to me. Slavery was perfectly legal. The Holocaust was legal under German law. If you are looking at American law to determine what was wrong with this terrorist attack, you've lost your goddamn mind. No, don't look at American law, look at fundamental principles of like what a country is and how they function. It also flagrantly doesn't matter what the previous regime was like. It is not the American Empire's job to determine what an evil regime is. We have long supported really fucking evil regimes. But if you do want to look at evil motherfuckers that could run Venezuela, look at the opposition leader who literally went to the American investment forum and said we're going to open them up to foreign investment, which is very clearly capitalist code speak for we're going to let you steal billions of dollars from us. She is selling Venezuela down the river through nationalistic fucking fascism. With the aiding and abetting of the hegemonic empire, that's fucking evil. And America is enabling it. All of these regimes from Brazil to Argentina to Chile that America has previously installed have slaughtered their people, look up Operation Condor. If you are cheering this on in any way, shape, reform, including repeating myths about Maduro and centering that rather than centering the harm that the American Empire is doing to South Americans right now, you are aiding and abetting in the new imperialism.

And it is what protects people like diplomats from being charged by foreign governments. It is what has protected literal fucking slaughterers like Pinochet from being charged, although that was gotten around in a specific instance. So regardless of what America tells you, if you have ever appealed to international law, if you have ever appealed to civility or peace or wanting an end to this, the most basic rule you can have is not charging foreign leaders in a domestic court, which is what Trump is claiming to do. There is no right to do that, and anyone that's ever appealed to it should be abhorred at this. But you're not gonna, because you don't actually care, right? Like, it doesn't actually matter. If you're worried about this, you probably don't even care about an international law, right? It was created by liberals to support liberal aims. But if you are a liberal and you appealed to international law, you probably don't mean it, because you were never bothered by the war crimes America committed. You were never bothered by America's flagrant, consistent violations of it. But I just wanted to say this so you know, anytime you appealed to international law in the future, I'm gonna point to this. What did we do about this? Because this is a clear, very, very set out, fundamental principle of international law. And if America ever appeals to it again, they're the biggest tipper.",

Now is the time for effective, militant organizing, starting with a general strike and ending in the end of the American Imperial project. That is because calling a congressperson will not work when Exxon Mobile has 200 people calling the congress people and they have every interest in invading Venezuela. It will not work when Chevron is funding billions of dollars into lobbying congress to do whatever they want. The American Empire at best can pretend to care what you think, but until you hit the economic fundamentals of the American Empire and stand in material effective solidarity with those it oppresses, it will not listen to you and that is what this has demonstrated. So yes, go out to a protest, yes show them that the American people stand in solidarity fantastic. But tomorrow and even better a year ago, two years ago, five years ago, we must organize militantly so that we are actually a threat to the biggest terrorist group on earth, the American Empire.",

Now, I don't have access to internal memos, but if I was the American Empire, seeing bricks being formed, seeing China be an effective and beneficial ally to some of the growing economies in the world, I would be scared shitless than an independent sovereign nation with access to some of the largest untapped oil reserves in the world was meeting with them. Not because I was concerned about the human rights abuses of whatever government that is, right? They don't give a fuck, America loves human rights abuses, but because it threatens my economic hegemony, and America has shown time and time and time again that the biggest crime you can commit is not allying with them. The crime that Cuba committed, as opposed to Nicaragua, was not allying with them. The crime that Brazil committed, that led to America overthrowing their government and implementing mass death campaigns against quote-unquote communist was not allying with them. The same crime that Indonesia and Chile and Argentina committed. So no, this is not new and no, this is not random. This looks exactly like America's classic playbook, which is take over any country that is not explicitly pledging allegiance to the flag.",

It's then just one hour ago publishing this article to manufacturer consent for American corporations to go in and steal Venezuelan oil on the basis of the oil industry not being productive. To be clear, any foreign corporation that enters Venezuelan soil is committing a war crime because they are aiding and abetting in an illegal invasion by the American Empire into a sovereign nation. And the New York Times has no issue with that as long as it increases shareholder value. Truly fucking disgusting, but at least this time they are not hiding it. We do not have to wait 10 years for CIA files to be released to learn, like we did with the Iraq War, that it was about oil. We do not have to wait 30 years to learn that the invasions and coups in Guatemala and Nicaragua were on the basis of protecting American economic interests. They are telling it to or faces. Propaganda well is running dry because they are being too obvious. Liberal propagandists like the New York Times used to be able to hide behind justification and justification and justification given by the regime, but Trump has come out and said it and made it obvious. This is about stealing resources, this is about undermining any threat, ideological material to the American Empire, and Venezuela was that. They were meeting with China and they were sovereign from American control. We can critique and condemn any leader that we want in the world, but the American Empire has no ground to stand on when they are funding and enabling despots across the world from Saudi Arabia to Israel. So please for the love of God, take them at their word and ignore the fucking lies. This is about oil, this is about undermining Venezuelan sovereignty, and it is not about protecting the Venezuelan people because America could let give less of a fuck about South American people. They have slaughtered millions.",

And that is important because American imperialism has long been a bipartisan issue, with both sides voting to sanction Venezuela which killed thousands of civilians each year, both sides spreading narratives that were made to manufacture consent for invading Venezuela, and both supporting previous regime changes across Nicaragua, Guatemala, Chile, Peru, and hyper-focusing on the current fascists that is just worse at lying about this particular intervention does nothing to undermine the actual mechanism of American imperialism that has murdered millions in the past 70 years. And it is a failure to the victims of American imperialism from Venezuela to Palestine to Sudan and Congo to fail to recognize the actual system that led to this. Democrats may condemn it, Democrats may come out, and even past war powers resolution against it, which they are doing. But the only reason they are doing that now is because Trump is not hiding it. They did not condemn the thousands of lives lost due to sanctions they imposed on Venezuela, they continued supporting it, and it is because they are covert imperialists where Trump is proud of it. Both are disgusting, both are committing violence, and one may reduce violence in the temporary time, but still support the system of violence that was created. And that is why we should not be calling for help from the liberals, but pointing out the hypocrisy and fundamental complicity that they have in this very violence.",

No, this is not about saving Venezuelans, America has slaughtered South Americans for the past 70 years.

There's a real conversation about what is to be done for and by the victims of regimes, especially those that were installed by America or caused by American repression. But America does not talk about those victims and therefore you should not engage with a conversation about them with America, because the only time you will hear any of those victims' names come out of America's mouth is when they are trying to justify creating more. Millions of people have suffered under American intervention. Hundreds of regimes have been toppled and installed by American intervention and has helped no one and it has caused thousands and thousands of lives. Do not fall for it again.",

America had obviously no legal right under any treaty, under any argument, under any justification for doing this. And any and all justifications that the regime of America provides is merely cover for aiming to steal resources and undermine sovereignty of the Venezuelan people. Now is not the time for debate as to whether this terrorism was legal, but action and discussion as to what is to be done about it. Imperialism and regime change in this area has murdered millions, cost billions and undermine the sovereignty of South America from Nicaragua to Guatemala to Chile to Argentina and to Venezuela. And this was done through multi billion dollar campaigns, manufacturing consent, slandering the people of South America, the governments and the states and cultures themselves. It's apporant, it's disgusting, it started 200 years ago and it's continuing today. And importantly, this is not Trump's war, this is the American Empire's war. Discussions as to how and what to do about Venezuela have been undergoing forever. That is why Venezuela has long been inserted into culture as the impoverished country, as the harmed country. These are narratives that were used actively by the American Empire to justify violating this sovereignty of the Venezuelan people. So stand unilaterally and unconditionally with the Venezuelan people today. The same fight against American imperialism we are seeing in Palestine, Sudan and Congo now only become more and more present at our doorstep in Venezuela.",

It actually doesn't threaten either of those immigrants are less dangerous and better for the economy than they'd have born people. It is about poisoning the sovereignty, which she literally just ripped from poisoning the blood of Americans. And then pretty much repeats that when she goes, we used to have a shared culture, we used to have a shared race, ethnicity. They care about mass immigration because it threatens having a white majority. They think it poisons the insert word that isn't just race here, sovereignty, which actually semantically makes no sense, which is how you know that it's just her messing up. She heard the words poisoning the blood, poisoning the race, poisoning the white youth, which are much more clear neo-Nazi terms and the news she couldn't say that on camera. But make no mistake, that is what is being believed. If not explicitly, implicitly, when what is centered is Latino migration, that is beneficial to America, fundamental to our economy, and fundamental to our culture. The reason it is threatening is not because of any of the made up bullshit they say, it is because they are white supremacists. And I want to be extremely clear here too. Liberals are the same way. Mass immigration reform happened under both Obama and Biden and Trump one and two. They both see immigration as a threat to the white supremacist colony of America. The debate they engage in is not whether it is but how to deal with it, whereas conservatives are more open about wanting to ethnically cleanse America and liberals are less. It is just on the conservative side that some people can be honest about that.",

He then goes on to cherry-pick shit about the Quran that looks bad. But I love this game because let's see what we can do with the Bible, which is the book the vast majority of American politicians swear in on. The Bible, which in some celebrated in fantaside, or about the numbers where it directly called for slaughter, genocide, and essay. Or how about in second kings where a guy mauled children with a bear because those children called him baldie? There are, of course, verses calling for the stoning of women who divorce their husbands, cutting off hands of thieves, banning women from temple or private spaces. That's not pretend like we can't do this with literally any religious book, or that the Quran is like notably worse than the Bible. It's not. The reason this is dangerous to you is because you are supporting Christian nationalism. So, Christianity intertwined with the government, which by the way is what the tradition of like swearing in on a Bible is, seems perfectly normal. But the second anyone says, well, I mean, if it's secular, then I'll just use a Quran. If it's going to represent the religion I'm using, let's use a Quran, let's use whatever we want. You go, this is terrifying. Religion is so scary. You're racist, right? And you're racist because Islamophobia is built off the racialization of Arabs as dangerous and animalistic, which is precisely what you're doing by characterizing their religion as particularly more violent or animalistic than yours.",

America's centuries-long revenge campaign against these two countries, as well as most in the global south that they have seeked to steal billions in resources from. Levyying to this day in illegal blockade against Cuba will repunish anyone who dares trade with them on equal footing. Or the multiple habitual and systemic coup d'etat as we've levied against Haiti to prevent any form of realistic, effective self-governance and produce excuses for the continuation of the American Empire? Teach us that the billion-dollar industry of imperial propaganda, the billion-dollar industry of imperial violence is not inevitable and does not always win. And the resistance and liberation of these people in these times stands as an example that all Western leftists ought to learn from. And the centuries-long slander campaign that we were taught about the Haitian Revolution, about the Cuban Revolution, should call on all of us to question everything we were taught in the imperial core about the oppressed nations, about the nations that we stole billions from. And this could not come at a more relevant time, with us invading Venezuela, invading Nigeria, invading Syria, and manufacturing more consent for invading Iran with the Women Life Freedom Movement, being picked up by almost every single major right-wing shil, Israeli shil in Maraudi shil online. It shows us that the fight against Western imperialism has not stopped. Not in Haiti, not in Cuba, not in Venezuela, and that means we cannot stop fighting. Just as those oppressed by the American Empire from Palestine to Korea have no choice but to continue doing.",

    "text": "You've heard about Sudan but don't know why you should care and don't know enough about it. I promise if you are interested in undermining American imperialism, you need to be paying attention to what's happening in Congo and Sudan. So let's start by recognizing the enemy, which is the United Arab Emirates. You know the UAE where Abu Dhabi in Dubai are? Yeah, they're funding an insurgent group in Sudan to engage in genocide, known as the RSF, and they were actually in the ICJ being accused by the same people accusing Israel of... Genocide, South Africa, recently, and they got out of it because of a technical reservation in the genocide convention. Not because the court found them not guilty. And this is following credible accusations of them actively funding the RSF, which is that they have all but admitted, and accurate and habitual reports of the RSF committing massive war crimes. And you might be asking Will, I'm an American, I see how we are connected to the genocide in Israel, how we connected this. Thus a starting place, the UAE was part of the Abraham Accords. To as an agreement, America facilitated and maintained to strong arm these countries into recognizing and supporting Israel. There are also the fourth largest receiver of American weapons in the Middle East. America has long maintained and profited from the existence of the UAE, which was built on slave labor. And the UAE's foreign power is an expansion and extension of Western imperialism largely. I want to be clear, this is not the exact same. The level of connection the UAE and Israel have to America are different. The conflicts are different and there is relevant analysis to be done as to how they are different. But if we as leftists are genuinely interested in undermining Western imperialism, bringing an end to the brutality of the American Empire, we must understand the expansiveness of it. And it is very clear that the massive increase in violence that the UAE is funding and inciting in Sudan must be a focus for what we must undermine. And so how you can start doing it is educating people on the connection between American imperialism and Sudan. And boycotting the UAE. This can be done first and foremost by not fucking visiting, but also if you go to boycottue.org, you can find targets of companies to target boycott. There's been a lot of discourse around this for a long time, but right now is the best time to start if you haven't already.",

Because his whole entire platform is based on finding people that are struggling financially and blaming them for their problems, which in individual cases seems harmless, but consistently showing stories of poor people that are struggling because they refuse to get out of bed. Does nothing but promote this fallacy that the reason there is poverty in America is because of individual choices. And not only does he spread this right-wing line, but he also does so in a way that explicitly appeals to right-wing propagandists, LGBT debt. God, I wonder who it's gonna connect those two. So I know that every single episode there is plausible deniability that his goal isn't to blame poor people for their problems, or maybe this individual could do better. But collectively, and his editorial choice to consistently bring them on, is pushing the political line. If all you are shown of stories of poor people are not people that got screwed over by a system, or people that are really trying their best, and just can't make ends meet, but are stories of people that are struggling because of choices they own made, or came from privileged background, which by and large is what K the Pamirs is showing. And especially, if you are given the emotional outlet that he gives to yell at, or demean, or diminish these people, there is no way that's not reflected in your politics. And it's intentionally done. For example, the headline I showed is not unique. His headlines have been misogynistic, homovobe, graces, etc. before. And that's not an accident. That's not being me being like, woke. That's what media literacy looks like. Connecting his demeaning or dismissive nature of people who struggle because they are in marginalized identities, because his goal is to spread right-wing propaganda. So please, learn to recognize what this looks like. This media is not a political. And when we talk about building media literacy, this is what we mean. Of course, he's not out here repeating Trump talking points. But when you are presented in a media ecosystem that demeans and diminishes certain personalities and identities, like he actively does to poor people and tacitly does to other marginalized groups, there's no way that's not internalized. And then, when it's internalized by enough, it's systematized. So we need to fight back on it on every single level. And you can call me woke or overly sensitive or whatever. It doesn't mean that what I'm saying isn't true. And it doesn't mean that the reason it hasn't been called out before is because America has been stripped of almost all of its media literacy.",

But a company can say my private property rights, my contract rights, my tort rights were violated. I can steal their property for the protection of private rights supersede massively public rights in international law. And this builds an alternative system. So there's hypocrisy. This is harmful if I let sovereignty. I could go on and on and on about how this is bad. But that's ISDS.",

    "text": "Not only did America not care about the genocide going into World War II, but they actively downplayed the interest of protecting Jewish Germans, because they didn't want to come off to pro-Jewish. This slowly changed throughout the war, and it is true that eventually that became the primary rallying call around World War II. But this was a consideration at the executive level of America, even into the Nuremberg trials, because anti-Semitism was that baked into American and Western society. This isn't even to speak about the tens, almost hundred, genocides that America has either actively done across the world or has been complicit in. America has never been on the side against genocide. They have happened to be on the side that happens to be fighting against a certain genocide, but it is by no mean a principled stance. So while it is ever more disappointing every single time they are, we cannot continue to be surprised by America doing precisely what it does best, which is imperialism, brutalization of natives, and colonialism. And that is why we must work against America, not for changing America. It has never been for liberation, it has been the thing we must liberate against.",

    "text": "It's much meat Hassan Piker, the 33-year-old streamer telling Gen Z that socialism rocks. Israel is a settler colonial estate and Zionists are in the Onazis. Meat the Free Press An organization that claims to be a new media company built on ideals that were once the bedrock of American journalism. Showing ideals of honesty, doggedness, and fierce independence. When you take two seconds to look at their founders and editors, you find out that the founder is Barry Weiss, who you might have heard of from making documentaries about how she felt intimidated because a Columbia professor talked about Israel. Or Abigail Scher, who is literally repeating Nazi level anti-trans propaganda. There is nothing independent or dogged about this Free Press. It is founded by an avowed Zionist who has spent her career dogging upon anti-ionists. The very academic engagement of Israel by a professor at Columbia who was literally hired to talk about in the Middle East caused her to feel like a victim. This alternative, independent media organization, according to the Wall Street Journal, increased in 62% in viewership following the October 7th war. And that is because this organization was never meant to be independent or alternative. And it is exactly built on the ideals that were once the bedrock of American journalism. American imperialism, and anti-queer degeneracy. So when you see shitheads like this coming after Hassan Piker, when they will feel like they are victims even when a Columbia professor talks about Israel, even when people dare observe that Israel is a colony doing a part-side. You know that he is doing something right. And just to be clear, I don't agree with Hassan on everything. I just think that when an organization that uses these obviously obfuscating language, Free Press, foundation of American democracy, you know, honesty, doggedness, but literally spend all of their time defending Israel and providing an alternative baseline, apologetic position on Israel, they have nothing valuable to add to a discussion. It is not a good faith critique. They are going after anyone that disagrees with Israel for any reason.",

Who should control Africa's resources? Foreign investors or Africans? Because these two companies that Canadian and British version of the same company seem to think the answer is foreign investors. Because this company, which searches and mines for uranium, found uranium in Niger and signed a contract with the previous governor of Niger. That government, of course, being installed by the French colonizers, which were recently kicked out by the new government of Niger. And then that government saying, hmm, this colonial contract isn't very good for us, said, no, no, no, we don't want to give you our resources for really cheap. And that made the foreign investors really sad. So they sued in ICSID, which once again, if they win, means that assets of Niger abroad can be stolen from them. And trade barriers can be put up to punish this decolonized nation for decolonizing. So we know where the corporations stand on this issue. They want control of Africa's resources. What's to be done? What the soon's a little more complicated? Because this company, right, the Canadian version, recently completed a frankly, really confusing corporate deal to go back on the Australian stock exchange. Which means that a ticker that represents some of their value is atomic-eagle-LTD, which doesn't highlight the Niger property on it. And so once again, I ask for the help of finance pros. Number one, can you explain to me this deal and what actually holds the rights to the Niger property right now? Which corporation? Number two, can you find me corporations, industries, areas, institutions that hold this stock? And number three, and most importantly, as always, what can we do to prevent it? Because there is always a divestment strategy. And this is once again a pretty small company. So the answer is, as always, find the stocks, threaten to divest unless they drop the suit. Because it should not be foreign companies that are deciding national policy. It should be the nation.",

    "text": "Basically, think about it like this. In the most simple case, country A, take Burkina Faso. Once to kick out French investors, right, which are French capitalists that came in and said, well, we're going to buy a bunch of land in exchange for a contract with Burkina Faso. We're going to pay a comparably diminished amount to the government, right? We're going to take all the resources from it. Let's say they were looking for something crazy like gold. And Burkina Faso, the country, prior to de-colonization, wrote a treaty with France, and actually wrote a treaty with a lot of countries, which tied it them to the World Bank, the ICSID, the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes, which basically said, we will respect international contracts that we sign. So say we respect that we will give access to these land rights in Burkina Faso for them to mine on. And then the people take over the government and say, fuck that. We own our own gold. We'll extract it ourselves. French investors get the fuck out. And then these French investors are annoyed. And they go, I'm really sad, right? And they can't sue in Burkina Faso courts, right? They can't say this government, they're not going to use Burkina Faso courts, right? Because the Burkina Faso government now has control of their laws. They go to an international tribunal, in this case, the ones that the World Bank set up. And they go, you broke your treaty that you signed. Now it's between France and Burkina Faso and all of the other bilateral treaties, which there are like 92 signatories of this treaty. And then the World Court rules against them and says, OK, these investors are right. They have the right to take these resources. And then they get damages, say, for example, $240 million in damages. And you're going, well, OK, how do they enforce it? If Burkina Faso government is in control of Burkina Faso, what are they going to do? Go and invade Burkina Faso? No, no. Because we have a worldly economy. And the general rule is that we have free trade, right? The general rule for everyone in power is that if American assets, for example, are held by France, France can't just steal them. And France can't pass a law and just steal France's assets. But if a international tribal unit like this says, yeah, you did wrong, Burkina Faso. Suddenly, if Burkina Faso, for example, has weapons being held by the West or gold being held in an American account, or, for example, wants to use US dollars because that is the world reserve currency to buy oil. And that's held in a foreign account. Suddenly, that foreign account is up for grabs. And if it's in a country like one of the 92 countries that are part of this treaty, then those French investors can go to that country and say, hey, look, that's Burkina Faso. I think that's the ex-NMI haven't checked. I'm so sorry. That's the Burkina Faso. Like assets, those are the government. They owe me money. Just give me that money.",

But none of those things are bad if we don't have a massive wealth inequality that produce systems of hierarchy. For example, I think we can all agree citizens united is bad, but that's because it allows people with a billion times more dollars than you, to have a billion times more speech than you. If that wasn't true, citizens united would not have the same effect and corruption on our democracies. And most worryingly, I'm seeing a lot of these motherfuckers that support capitalism. They, glee believe in good billionaires, will bitch and moan about some of the symptoms of this problematic system, but not have a theory of change on how to prevent it. And if you see people like this, don't fucking trust them because it will not go well. You can't have a democracy where there are billionaire oligarchs.

    "text": "Welcome to episode 1 of Corporations of the New Empire. And this starts with a question, who should control resources in Africa? Africans are multinational corporations. Because this is Sarama resources. And this is Burkina Faso. It used to be ruled by a government installed by the French Imperial forces until two years ago where it kicked them out. And that sucks for Sarama because they were finding gold in that area. And now they feel like they're entitled to damages because the new government said, no, no, no, we own our own gold. If Burkina Faso is found not to own its own resources because of a contract that the government in power did not sign and was signed in 2007 by a government controlled by France, then due to a treaty they once again did not sign, assets that they hold abroad could be seized from it. And tariffs and other trade barriers could be placed up to punish this now decolonized nation. So let me ask you again, who should control Africa's resources? Foreign companies like Sarama, which is based in Canada or the actual people in Burkina Faso. For me, I think it should be the Burkina Faso people, not France, which installed the previous government, not Canada through its multinational corporations and not the capitalists class of the West. And this is the part where I ask y'all's help because Sarama is a publicly traded resource company in Canada. It's very little value proposition, other than this arbitral tribunal award that it has yet to win, which means that there is a day vestment strategy here and I need y'all's help in finding it. If you can point me to fucking public institutions that can be affected, local councils, city councils, states, right, universities, pensions that are invested in this, which ETFs are having it, we can do a pressure campaign to prevent this. This is its ticker. Please finance, bros, now is your time. If we can find enough things to threaten to divest from this company with the simple demand of drop the case, you can literally affect the gears of neo-colonialism as we are seeing them in real time because this is a pretty fucking small company that is suing a sovereign nation for over a quarter billion dollars. The fact that this is even possible is fucking atrocious but the fact that it's preventable is way more hopeful.",

    "text": "Who should have more rights? People or corporations? Because right now in most countries, corporations have way more rights. More specifically, these countries, because in all of these countries, a private corporation can sue a full-sauvered nation, and if they win, all of these countries will enforce their damages. That is because of this, ICSID, an acronym I rule never remember, of the International Center for Settlement Investment Disputes. Whereas there's no international human rights court, for example, where an individual person can sue a country and have the rewards and damages enforced by other countries. The ICJ only takes states as litigants, the ICC same. Just to highlight the scale of this, $113 billion has been awarded to investors. And this has been used to challenge government's regulation like water pollution controls, fracking bands, regulations on oil and mining. Because many countries that have signed free trade treaties, which they were forced to sign in order to get international aid, simply cannot afford the billions of dollars required of them. If investors say, you're violating my rights by not allowing me to water pollute. So if you're interested in learning more, go to Global ISDS tracker. Because when we say we're anti-neo-impurealism, this is what we mean, allowing Western capital to determine the policies of foreign nations, rather than the people in those nations. And if you're interested in two recent examples, watch part one and two of corporations on the new empire. Because this shit's nasty, but there's something we can do about it, and it's really fucking powerful. Which is actually organizing against the often quite small companies that leverage these very powerful systems to force small countries to cuck themselves.",

I previously showed this map, showing that America likely will become a majority-minority state in by 2050 or 2040. But I forgot to mention this map. For more accurately, this, because this demonstrates how Israel's also scared shitless of becoming a majority Arab country, which would happen if they let birth rates and actual sovereignty for the Palestinian people, i.e. right to return, happened. And it's exactly what we're seeing happen in Israel proper. That is why they need to keep bringing more immigrants in. What I mean by it being Haiti is that the Haitian Revolution is still alive and well in the White supremacist metamory, which is a revolution primarily of former slaves, taking over sovereignty of the place that they effectively built with their labor and destroying the white supremacist system. And the way we know this is still alive and well in the White supremacist memory is because America has not let Haiti fucking forget it. Having cood almost every single democratic regime that Haiti has to attempt to implement and installing extraordinary authoritarian and harmful regimes in their place. And this is not even primarily because America has an economic interest in it. America primarily has an ideological interest in it. If Haiti, a home ruled, ex-colony, can be seen to succeed, then the American project suggesting that civilization, which has always been synonymous with whiteness in the colonnars' mind, defined by racial supremacy and racial superiority just as Israel has been, support for that ideology will go down. And that is why we, who want to undermine those ideologies, need to actually learn the history of people that effectively did. Because my god, the white supremacists do, and they're working as hard as possible to make sure it never repeats itself.",

That's because the most classic and historically used slur against people that were actually effective in standing up for minority rights in America and across the world has been race trader. Or some other variants that I'm not going to say online, y'all. But the reason they pull out this historic slur and historic antagonism to people they see actually challenging the racial and class hierarchies in America is because they're fucking scared. The reason white supremacists don't like white people that don't push racism and actually anti-racist in effect is because it scares them. And what's the funny is the whole I'm an ally thing has not received the heat from white supremacists that things like, hey, I'm actually going to do mutual aid with African American or Latino organizations in my community. I'm actually going to go build cross-cultural connections and see how I can be helpful to their liberation. I'm going to recognize that America has long been a white supremacist state and it was maintained to protect whiteness. That analysis got the heat from the white supremacists. That analysis got me almost docs multiple times. Other analysis didn't. And so if you want to guide on how to actually be effective in undermining the white settler nation of America, a good starting point is seeing what actually pisses off the Nazis. A good start is when they pull out their not-so-creative slurs against you. That's how you know you're challenging it. Because they are the avatars of the white supremacy built into America, liberals just lie about it.",

Because I've made videos talking about how it's evil, but our messaging that it is just evil and we should stop using it isn't working, it's not gonna work. Now let me be clear, I agree it's evil, I agree Gemini and Claude and ChatGPT are doing irreparable harm to our society, culture and environment. That said, you on this app right now are using AI. The FYP algorithm is using AI, and anyone that's experienced that that is better than the Instagram algorithm has experienced why AI is better and useful. If you see captions here, that was generated by t-t-t-t-t-t-do, generative AI. Anyone who has read captions or asked for them to be added for accessibility purposes knows that AI is useful. So yes, we need a message that properly contextualizes American AI and AI developed by capitalism, and especially the bubble around this kind of mythical concept of this technology as bad and evil, and also there is room for social taboos in shaming how certain people use certain technologies absolutely. And for the love of God if you get in my comments and saying I'm just being lazy, you haven't watched this whole video. But what I want to see and where I don't want the conversation to end is no one should ever use AI. I actually think that is a Puritan stance, right? It is not a helpful stance, it is not a stance anyone on this app or other app hold, obviously. And it is reactive, it's not helpful. I think we should take inspiration from what people slurice as, which is led heights. Led heights didn't believe in the technology never being used. That's not what they believed. What they believed was that it should benefit the workers that it was displacing. They were happy to use the technology, they just wanted it to be implemented in a way that benefited them. And I think if we learn from that, let's look at how to use this technology, not literally as it's given to us, but conceptually to benefit the workers. And here's my proposal, here's my proposal. You don't got it, it's not perfect, it's not a level first step, right? Use Chinese AI. Say hey, don't use Gemini, which is literally burning American communities and burning the earth, use DeepSeek, which can be used locally on most Macs. And it's pretty much as good. If you need to use it to run operations, yeah, it's as good, it's cheaper, it violated less copyrights in doing so, it fucks over the AI that we are primarily critiquing, right? Yeah, it's destroying our economy or culture, etc. And it provides you the same benefits that you're actually living and experiencing. And then there's a discussion about, okay, well, maybe we don't need these benefits, maybe there is a benefit to doing other things that actually make our brain better. Yes, but do you see what I mean? Is the conversation continues? It doesn't just end? Cool, that's my kind of rant on AI. And if you have suggestions, leave them in the comments. I've seen some like propel-stagned organizations building and creating better different AI. I've seen direct actions against AI data centers in America that I really support. And I've seen really clever uses of things like DeepSeek to do effective large scale activism. That's what I wanna see. Not bringing Puritan shame into this discussion, unhelpfully. You can use it helpfully though.",

    "text": "Israel does not give a fuck about the residents of Somali land. Nor does it genuinely care about complex geopolitical and moral question of which countries should be recognized. This game of recognition is purely instrumental in politics and Israel is doing it for a very clear reason. To do what it has always done, which is act as a proxy of the American Empire to promote it and America's interests in the region. So if you're interested in a longer explanation of that, go watch my recent video where I very clearly explain this is an aim for Israel to complete its ethnic cleansing of Palestinians because they recently spoke to Somali land, people, to enable the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians to Somali land. And two, this is a play of the American Empire to get a military base and thus more control of with the straight of aden, which is crucial to global trade. And the government of Yemen in that area has disrupted in solidarity with Palestinians. It is all connected and we should care about what people in that area want, but Israel doesn't. So when having a discussion about the recent recognition or the complex geopolitical question of what should be recognized and what shouldn't, don't pretend like the people we are debating with give a fuck. They're playing a different game and we have to meet them where they're at if we ever want to win.",

    "text": "Nikiminage helped contribute to the strikes in Nigeria this week. I'm not kidding. Nikiminage spoke on behalf of the American Empire to the UN, repeating a false claim about Christian genocide in Nigeria. And that exact false claim is one of the reasons Trump is using to justify striking areas in Nigeria, quote-unquote, against extremists, despite recently reporting coming out of Nigeria showing that extremists were not in that area. And more importantly, the claims of Christian genocide simply being false, not a single internationally recognized human rights organization or international watchdog agrees that what is happening in Nigeria can be properly classified as a genocide. And yet the American Empire, who has very rarely given a fuck if a genocide is genuinely happening, is pushing millions of dollars into spreading this myth. Why? Because they want every reason in the world to intervene in this area that has been the center of modern decolonial movements, with more than four having recent revolutions against the former colonizers. And so, of course, getting imperial troops and imperial resources back on the ground in this area, even if it is already with a close-align Nigeria, and the deeply corrupt Nigerian government is an aim of the American Empire, especially to maintain control over the large resource-rich areas in that area, such as those that have lithium. So yeah, Nikiminage literally helped bomb people that killed Christians and Muslims this week. And the effects of people losing their goddamn minds in America and serving the interests of the American Empire don't start or end here.",

    "text": "New York State is set to pass an assisted suicide law, and I want to remind you all that assisted suicide is not a leftist taken America. Now, let's be clear. You can believe that people should, in principle, have the right to determine whether and how they die. But, in the context of white supremacist America, where laws like this have been used actively and systemically to either kill or infurtilize black and brown people, especially and disabled people particularly, being these laws gain popularity and even be co-signed by liberals in liberal states during the rise of fascist thought and culture in America should be super concerning to y'all. Because this is not about the principle debate. This is about reinstating the gears of the state to choose who lives and dies and whether we can instrumentalize certain medical institutions to make that decision. And that is because how this will be implemented regardless of the principle will and has always been deeply ableist, deeply classist and deeply racist. Let me make that just a little bit clearer because for y'all who don't know your eugenics history, we've had eugenics up to the late 1900s. And we were having forced hysterectomies in fertilization of Latinos on the border, even up until the Trump won administration. So this tradition of eugenics, ableism, racism and classism is alive and well and giving the state another tool to justify and instrumentalize that is deeply scary. Especially when the context of politics is not one of like kind of hippy-dippy liberalism, but far right-wing eugenics and liberal co-signing and moderating towards that. This is a symptom of that just like all the others and you should find it concerning.",

    "text": "Israel has recognized Somali land, this is what it means and why you should care. And this is quite complicated but I promise you it's worth it. First of all, this is what Somali land is. It's part of modern-day Somalia. Yesterday, Israel was the first nation in the world to recognize it as a sovereign nation as opposed to a part of Somalia, which has been rebuked by almost every single member of the African Union because it violates the sovereignty of Somalia. And I'm going to add a lot of context, but what is important here is Israel doesn't give a fuck about autonomy of an African nation. And this is totally divorced from the argument about what a country is. This is a purely political play by Israel and by extension the American Empire. Immediate context is that Israel has an explicit interest in using Somali land to ethnically cleanse Gossens. This is something you might hear in the next coming days, but there is more to this. It is not just Israel's interest, it is America's. For two reasons. First of all, here's Somalia, Somali land, here's Djibouti. And here is the Strait of Adnan, here's Yemen, here's where the Houthis have control. Got it? The reason Djibouti is important is because it is where a lot of people have military bases to protect the Strait of Adnan. And importantly, America has one and China has one because Djibouti is moving closer and closer to the Brics countries, Brazil, Russia, India, China. And this territory is incredibly important to America because this is where the Houthis, Yemen's government in that area, did the previous blockade in solidarity with the Palestinian people against Israel? Do you see it coming together? America's position in protecting a geopolitically important Strait is being challenged by increased Russian and Chinese influence in the place that it has the military bases. This is why what I consider to be the voice of American imperialism, the Heritage Foundation says that the US should recognize Somali land. Of course, they justify it with cultural other bullshit, but they don't care. They are acting in their interests of protecting the American Empire. Because ultimately, Somali land has offered explicitly multiple times to exclusively give a naval and military base to America if they recognized it, which would strengthen their position in the area, help them secure the Adnan Strait, help in their war against the Houthis that they are aligned with the Saudis against, and push back against Chinese influence in the area that is China's only military base. Outside of China, of course. So when you have analysis of Israel being an outpost of the American Empire, it becomes super clear what's happening. Israel is acting in its own interests, but is acting as a massive clear proxy for American imperial interests, protecting security interests in that area, acting against the sovereignty of the nations to protect the Empire's control of that territory, and fighting back against other conflicting, either sovereign, national, or international pressures to back off from that area. So do not be confused. This play with Somali land, maybe America didn't say yes, but they certainly didn't say no, because this is just as much in Israel's interests as it is in America, because they are not different things.",

You don't hold someone accountable to themselves, the fuck? You hold them accountable to the harm that they cause someone else. Because accountability, right, is a part of re-habilitative or transformative justice system models. And you are just using the words to engage in your own Puritan values. Holding someone accountable to themselves is nonsense. That doesn't make any sense. Who, what is the harm that they're preventing to whom for what? So let's just clarify. Because this term has just been taken by the internet for, I'm angry at you, I don't respect you and I don't think you should respect yourself. But what it actually means is like, you caused harm to someone, right? That person holds you accountable to that harm and engages in like a re-habilitative justice system with you, right? Whatever the harm is, they engage in some form of thing that mends that relationship, takes account for the harm, and builds better systems to prevent it and account for it in the past. It is not just I made a dumb decision. Now I have to kind of be self-flagulated for the next like 30 minutes by Caleb Hammer.",

    "text": "I've just bombed Nigeria and everyone is misreporting it. Myself included, because I forgot to mention one of the most important things. And that is this, the Alliance of Sahel State. This is Nigeria, and this is a union of home-ruled African countries that have recently kicked out their former colonizer, France, which America is famously allied with. And this alliance just called recently for a joint large-scale operation against extremists, the same extremists that Trump claims to be fighting in Nigeria. For context, these three states, as well as I believe one of these now, within the past two years, have undergone mass revolutions against the French colonizers to kick them out and retain control of their resources. And America, through labeling them terrorists, spreading and propagating mass propaganda campaigns against them. And at times, enabling actual military violence against them, have clearly labeled and expressed their interest in ending this home rule. Like for example, did you see that story about the criminalization of homosexuality in Burkina Faso? I wonder why they mention that, and not the criminalization of homosexuality in Saudi Arabia. America's ally. So yes, violence in this region is not only to immediately grab the resources of Nigeria, which already has quite a strong security relationship with America, but also to justify American imperial violence in this region to destabilize the countries that certainly do not. Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger. And that is because the American empire has always relied on extracting resources from the global south, and these three home rule countries greatly threaten that. So it is important not only to undermine the myths that they make up to justify this violence, but search for the real reason they are aiming to inflict it. And that, from my analysis, will always come down to the American empire continuing to do what it always does, extracting from the global south. And we should not search for excuses for them to do it, and we should destroy each and every excuse they do. There is no Christian genocide. There is no validity to them attacking ISIL when they also funded ISIL. And they are certainly not protecting African sovereignty by attempting to undermine popular regimes that literally ousted colonizers. It is also illegal under both federal and international law, condemn this on all fronts, and tolerate no lies about it.",

That didn't happen. It is not about ISIL. America has funded ISIL at times. America works with the people that fund ISIL. And America is interrupting the operations that actually undermine ISIL in Nigeria. The Nigerian government. Because let's be clear. Bombing Nigeria, even if there are terrorists that the Nigerian government is fighting, is illegal, both under federal and international law. And this is not about protecting Christians because even the Christians in Nigeria, by and large, do not support American intervention, which still kill Christians. Well, beyond justifying why there is no justification for this. But what I want you to learn from this. The very clear line. That a justifying narrative spread for the past year by motherfuckers like Bill Mar. And then taken up by the right-wing mainstream of a Christian genocide in Nigeria, which was never happening. And no international human rights organization agrees with. Directly led to people being killed by American bombs. It is important that we undermine these myths that are used very quickly by every single liberal and conservative mainstream institution to justify violating the sovereignty of another nation killing its citizens very clearly to steal its resources. Something America and the West has done four times over in Nigeria as they funded coup after coup after coup after coup.",

And it's this one, which projects that in 2050, America will no longer be majority white, with the biggest differential being Hispanic people. And if that doesn't explain why the reactionary forces in America, both liberal and conservative, are deeply, vehemently and systemically against immigration, I don't know what does, really. Because the white nationalists are right on one point, which is that it is basically impossible in the modern era to maintain a white nation that is not majority white. That is why Israel is so interested in demographic shifts and maintaining a majority Jewish population. That is why almost every supremacist society ended in genocide, and that is why America today is working so hard to prevent more Latinos, to maintain what America has always been, which is a white nation built upon the backs of black and brown people. And right now, it will inevitably stop being that. Our choice is what happens next. Either the supremacists get what they want, which is to end the inclusion of Latino people as equal people in society, a more drastic measure reducing the population in America of Latino people, which is what we're seeing right now, an ethnic cleansing. And if you don't want those two things to happen, then you need to very quickly and very effectively get a shit ton more radical, because an ethnic cleansing of Latinos is happening and is a natural consequence of the American project. So we need to very quickly end the American project.",

And that's a lot. But it makes a lot of sense if you know what Saudi Arabia is, which is a little bitch for the American government. Basically, the Saudi monarchs are deeply unpopular as are the Jordanian Hashemite monarchs. And those two regimes pretty much only exist because of Western support either from Britain or from America and now very clearly America. Israel obviously is a proxy of the American Empire, and all three of those places have strong military ties to America. And the Abraham Accords are effectively away for Trump, who is just demanding more and more national allegiance to America to demand that of the Arab nations. But it's not terribly surprising that the Saudi royal family, a literal absolute dictatorship of a very small group of monarchs, are perfectly fine backstabbing their populace, right, who largely don't support Israel, along with the Jordanian populace, who are widely supportive of Palestinians, because it benefits their security relationship with America. And it has long been suggested that one of the primary demands is that Saudi wants to become a nuclear power. So that we are literally playing with fire to support a absolute dictatorship in Saudi Arabia because it supports Israel, which supports America's interests in that territory. And I say all of it because understanding any of this helps you understand the connected web that is required to undermine Israel, because Israel is, after all, just a massive military base for the United States in the Middle East. And Saudi Arabia as a regime only exists because we support their autocracy. So if we want to undermine any of this, we have to undermine all of it. And that starts with strong staunch anti-imperialism.",

    "text": "Anti-Semitism is bigotry against Jewish people. And points like this, which say, effectively, we can't be anti-Semitic because we're not going against Arabs, is not true or helpful. Let me explain. First of all, this is the definition also said in Oxford reference. It is discrimination against Jews. An anti-Semitism was literally made as a replacement to Yudinhas, right, hatred of Jews, to make it sound more scientific. And that is where this point comes from. They made up these categories, semites of people who speak Semitic languages, which both people who speak Arabic and speak Hebrew are a part. The issue is, number one, the racial science they used to do it is outdated, right? Semitic is used in some niche places, but not really as a racial category anymore, because this term developed and started as just anti-Jewish hatred. So when you make this point, number one, you're wrong. You're engaged in an etymological fallacy. Language is not defined by the roots of it. Language is defined by how it's used, and this term is used regarding Jewish people. Second of all, you are reifying Nazi-era racial science that is not helpful. Third, you are going against what generally Arab groups that work against anti-Arab racism want that to be called. They're not calling for it to be called anti-Semitism. They're calling for it to be called anti-Arab racism because that's more accurate to how it is used in modern language. So yes, there is a discussion about whether we should change the language to go from anti-Semitism, which literally calls back to eugenics-esque racial science, to anti-Jewish hatred or something like that. I fall on the side of keeping the history of that term, so we understand it and can analyze it because anti-Semitism as a structure to understand anti-Arab racism is very helpful, for example. But that's a discussion we had. What's not to be had and not helpful is just rejecting that anti-Semitism is anti-Jewish hatred. That's what it is. That's what the word means. That's what everybody understands the word to mean. And rejecting that doesn't help anyone. And as I said, for three reasons, actually is harmful. So please stop.",

Dair suggests that the Tel Aviv fashion week, a city that is literally built upon the bones of Palestinians and shut down Palestinian houses, is celebrating peace. It's celebrating peace when the government you work for is murdering Palestinian women and children and innocent civilians. It's celebrating peace when you are literally walking on the graves of Palestinians that were expelled to establish Tel Aviv. No, it's not about peace.

It massively benefits the Democrats to release a few pictures every day that they don't want to be asked questions about why they failed the government shutdown. And honestly, Trump releasing a bunch of black documents and people being mad at it is better than people being mad at him for invading Venezuela, which he's probably going to do this month, or striking Syria, which he already did. So yes, they absolutely should be released. It is disgusting and heinous that they have not been. That said, they are being used as a political tool by everyone. The Democratic Judiciary Committee, not releasing all of the pictures they have all at once, is a choice. Trump playing games releasing some and not is a choice. He could have just not complied and nothing would have happened. Instead, he made a meme of it. And that is because it will always be less challenging to their regime to focus on interpersonal matters of the fascists that we already fucking don't like, than actually addressing the policies that they're doing. Because Trump is so happy to be slandered, to be lied about, as long as his oligarch friends continue being able to plunder the global south, which is what he's doing to manufacture consent to invade Venezuela.

She's absolutely right about electoral politics, but that highlights the limits of electoral politics, because as leftists, our goal should not be just to get Baptists to go to church, but to get more Baptists, get better Baptists, and bake better churches. And to take this metaphor out of metaphor, what I mean is electoral politics is about being a big coalition that gets the people that are just not engaged to engage in the minimal, teeniest possible way and represent that change. Whereas the rest of politics, things we do every other day to change our culture engages politics, the media, the conversations we have with our friends and grandparents, and the actions we have to build better in different coalitions and more politically educated ones, that builds the thing that electoral politics reacts to. Electoralism is not a vehicle of change. It is a bad exchange rate of change to action. And we as leftists can build systems that have a better exchange, right? Mutual aid organizations, better communities, unions, militant defense organizations. And we can build better Baptists that maybe they vote, and maybe we have a really interesting discussion about how to use the power that we build as better leftists to vote, but also go to the other churches and do really good work in them. And this is a superstructure and discussion around electoralism as a whole that is often lost in my opinion, actively ignored when electoral season comes around. When leftists come into the electoral system saying, look here are the critiques and issues we have, and electoralism by definition can't be enough, and then liberals scream at us. And I understand there are different discussions, there are lots of discussions going on, and I have absolutely no interest in defending everyone for everything. But I think keeping in mind that electoralism will never be enough and should never be enough for leftists will help contextualize when we respond to it as if it's not enough. And actually the primary job of leftists, the Lib Democrats and the establishment can figure out the demographics and whatever the fuck right. They can figure out where their voters are, what they're doing, etc. But our goal is to build more politically educated people and build more politically viable and better exchange rate coalitions and organizations. Because as it stands, electoralism has a really bad exchange rate of change to action. And oftentimes the people acting within the electoral system shut that down and calm down the change. By calling us radicals for example.",

Oh, I'm sorry. Is that not theological? We also claim that the only reason Gaza is not rebuilding is because Hamas refuses to disarm. But I don't think it's Hamas bombs that destroyed those buildings. Oh, I actually don't think it's the Hamas blockade that's preventing food and aid from going into Gaza. I don't think it's Hamas that has violated the ceasefire every single day and killed over 100 people since the quote unquote ceasefire. No, all of that was Israel. Because Israel is the one committing widespread genocide in Gaza. Not Hamas. And if you want Hamas to disarm, I don't even know what vague metric you could use to call them a terrorist organization. Who needs to disarm as opposed to the IDF, which is literally terrorizing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians right now today because they have killed hundreds of thousands of them. This is nothing but what aboutest war propaganda? It's disgusting, it's expected, and just don't fall for it. Because God knows it's not gonna fucking stop.",

What you're saying only makes sense if you're trying to defend your own sense of not being a white supremacist. Because what I think happened is the same reason people were xenophobic to the Irish and Italians, right, Intel they conform to whiteness, right? Like I think that Intel, a certain immigrant class has conformed to whiteness, their existence in the nation will appear to be an offense against the culture of that nation. And we saw this exact rhetoric against Italian as an Irish in the 1920s, 1910s, we saw the exact same rhetoric against East Asians prior to that, and we saw the exact rhetoric now against Latinos. I think what you're saying conform to whiteness when I think what you mean to say is conform to American culture. No, because they're not conforming to black and brown culture and black and brown people are still seen as an assault on American culture often. I would die, I don't agree with you on that disagree. Okay, I think African Americans, if you ask them, are often otherwise from American culture by merit of their engagement with their own culture. Absolutely. Afro-American culture is seen as other than the general American culture. If you look at white supremacist like pig headsets talking about beardos, right, that is part of the black and brown identity that is being expelled. The understanding of Christianity that white evangelicals in the American government currently are proposing is directly adult.",

We can engage with it as a different system, but it does exist. But even if you don't want to engage with that, I think there is a really compelling argument that you should care about anti-Semitism right now, regardless of the scale of lived experience of anti-Semitism you have, because understanding anti-Semitism allows us to build an incredibly helpful and necessary model of how bigotry in the modern world works. Very simply, if you understand the models and caricatures and systems of oppression, anti-Semitism fueled under the Nazis, under Mussolini, and even under the American regime, you have a better way of understanding how Arabs are talked about today, or even Asians are talked about today. Those same caricatures are used against Arabs and used against Asians and using against black and brown people. The idea that Jews are outsiders is directly applied to Arabs, right? Senator Tuberville explicitly said that Muslims should go back to their country and have a higher allegiance to Islam than they do have America, which directly matches the dual loyalty trope, which is an anti-Semitic trope.",

Barring actual Palestinians, or those directly affected, this issue is salient in America because of American imperialism. And if we don't address the wide breadth of manifestations and origins and systems of oppression that involve American imperialism, we will never hope to be an effective ally even to Palestinians. For example, if your singular background is pro-Palestinian advocacy, but you don't contextualize it in greater American imperial struggles in things like Vietnam, or Taiwan, or Korea, or Sudan, or Congo, what we will end up doing is putting Israel on a pedestal that actually benefits them. Or if you haven't fully undermined your white evangelicalism, you will end up repeating the systems of oppression such as white savior syndrome, or being historically patronizing to the oppressed peoples we're trying to be allies to. And I mean this much more as a call-in than a call-out, because I get focusing on the biggest issue. Israel is objectively killing the most people of any American colony. But if we want to understand how to build better systems within America to attack that system of imperialism, if we want to build better coalitions across the world to undermine that system, you need to widen your scope. Or as I've repeated in many, many videos, you will fall into tropes that are unhelpful, and be rife to fall into fascist hands.",

Europe makes more from finding US companies than it does from all the taxes its tech companies pay. Just real quick, number one, why do you think they're being fined? And number two, why do you think they keep operating in Europe to pay those fines? It's because it's profitable to do so. Because they want access to the European market. It's not America or American companies subsidizing Europe. It's Europe saying if you want us to give you access to our market share, which is profitable for you, here are the conditions. And Apple and Microsoft and Google have every choice to actually number one, follow the requirements, right, which often they do. By the way, that's why you have USBC on your iPhone. We're number two, pay the fine and still be profitable within the market, which they also do. Google pays literally millions of dollars and paid over a billion of dollars to Ireland. And this is something people get wrong on almost every single facet of the American Europe relationship. It's not Europe like leaching off of America. It is America profiting off of Europe as a proxy state, both with NATO where we basically have control over their military and fund their military to use this proxy state against Russia or against the Middle East. And to make sure, for example, Iran does enough control over Europe, which they would, given their natural gas relationship, or how American companies want to operate in Europe, just as they want to operate in China, for example, which also has heavy restrictions on what Apple can do. And in order for American capital to come in and profit, there's minor pushback in the form of like a few fines. It is incredibly rare that America is the victim in foreign policy. And it is almost always true that America is the perpetrator of violence. It's possible there are other perpetrators, but almost never is America the victim. And if you approach it with that mindset, it becomes a lot more clear that these fines are the minor pushback of Europeans at the cost of massive profits of these corporations in Europe. And that is what actually happens when you look at the numbers.",

Other groups it means offering multiple land agreements and being consistently rejected by Arab leadership. Hope I think you misspoke there bud.

So when is the time to protest her? According to y'all, not when she's running, not pre-primary, which never happened, and not after she lost? When is the correct time to point out that a war criminal is doing war crimes? Because you have an infinite level of excuses for her? Or absolutely no reason? No, she is not irrelevant anymore, she's probably gonna try and run next time. No, even if she wasn't running, she wouldn't be irrelevant, she is a huge influence in the Democratic Party. And no, even if she wasn't influential, it wouldn't matter, because the whole entire point is to set up a social barricade against war criminals. Hey, if you don't want to be heckled at your fucking reading tour, maybe don't commit war crimes. We didn't forgive the motherfuckers doing war crimes ever before. We hunted them down for 70 years. Why the fuck would we start now? And if you want to say it's a double standard, I mean, maybe true for liberals, but leftists have been punching fascists forever. If you've ever seen that clip of the anarchist giving the, I forget which right wing or a proper fucking smack in the face, oh, nothing's been more cathartic. Seeing Henry Kissinger heckled at?

So if you're saying not enough is happening, my only solution to you is go make more happen. Don't bitch in moan that people are heckling the last Democratic presidential nominee.

And if there's any time to play purity politics, it's during primaries. But go on. There will not be any moment in time that we won't incur a moral injury. That being said, we have to stop prioritizing moral injury, that's individual, over material reality. Quick, guess what they're describing as moral injury. Yeah, that's right, people dying in Palestine. And this is a flagrant example of anti-air racism, labelling the harm and death of Palestinians at the hand of American weaponry as mere moral injury, while validating the very real harm that you point to in this video of trans people not feeling safe or black and brown people having a lived worst experience. That is the most classic case of anti-air racism, other rising and dismissing the harms that we caused to them. And this model of racism, which labels like the harm to the other as mere moral, while the harm to us as very real, is a very common model of racism that was applied to black and brown people in America, and is today very clearly applied in Israel against Arabs. If we want to have a discussion about how leftists and people that are progressive want to engage with electoralism and the compromises we have to make in different contexts, great, I'm so here for that discussion. For example, like I don't think the concept of like a limous test is super helpful. I think we need a more contextual nuanced discussion of how to use our votes and when not to. And what are the tools we have? Great, let's do it. But not a single one of those conversations, which I've engaged in, look at my previous videos, starts with flagrant and open anti-air racism. This is not helpful and it is not liberatory. So you can say that the people that are saying you just shouldn't vote or shouldn't vote for blank and blank are wrong, analytically or wrong morally, but starting by demeaning the harm in Palestine as mere moral injury or the complicity that openly Zionist candidates have in that harm as mere moral injury, as opposed to material reality is not on the gaslighting, right? It's not. We see the people dying and we see these systems that are causing them to die, but it is repeating the very structures of racialization and racism that I think you think you're undermining, which great, try to deconstruct. It seems you've deconstructed some anti-black racism, which I'm still working on as well as everyone, but you've not even attempted to deconstruct anti-air racism and no conversation starts without recognizing that that deconstructs is necessary. So please take down this racist video, it's nasty, it's silly, and make a different, better conversation about electoralism, validating the harm that people are telling you. I'm happy to explain my theory of change without being racist. Are you?",

And if you have a disagreement with me when I condemn any given American politician, my question to you is why? What's different? Because the scale of catastrophe that America is inflicting in Iraq, in Palestine, in Afghanistan, in Libya, in Sudan, is not lower, and not a single person working within the American system and maintaining power in it is doing enough or capable of doing enough to undermine their moral complicity in that system. So if you can understand how German citizens existed during that time, Israeli citizens existed during that time, you understand how American citizens do. And you understand how we can condemn all the politicians while working in the system to change it functionally and working outside of the system to change it fundamentally. And I would like anyone coming from a condemnation of individual politician, a condemnation of politicians as a whole, electoralism as a whole, to understand this perspective. Because as Americans we are consistently displaced from the extraordinary damage that our system is doing every single day. So if you think you would do anything during a time of great tragedy, as is 1930s in Germany, as is Israel today, consider what you're doing now. Are you trying to change the system, or are you focused on the limits of that system?",

    "text": "I could tell one thing to myself three years ago, it is that people are not secretly trying to be less progressive or less leftist than you, they often just don't have the tools to do so. Because seeing people fall for the propaganda that the American Empire has released over the past 70 years is fucking frustrating and seeing it makes me want to imply malice, but it is often not that. The people spewing this propaganda, often members of the working class, are often not equally, but equivalently victims of this propaganda and spreaders and perpetrators of it. So when you meet someone that is saying something that's not true or propagandized or maybe even quite fascistic enabling, try to first see if they have the tools to undermine it, the analytical tools, the even like communist theoretical tools to undermine it before attacking them for pretending to be not as progressive, attacking them for being disingenuous. Because oftentimes they genuinely believe what they're saying, they genuinely believe the hypocrisy they're engaged in, they just don't understand how it is hypocritical, as would anyone living in one of the most propagandized nations in the world and in history. I don't mean this to be condescending, I'm working through hundreds of years of imperial propaganda as well, I get things wrong and I have gotten things wrong. But I would like for myself and for the people I engage with to at least meet them starting with some grace.",

    "text": "The right wing does not care if they win culture wars. Because they win by fighting. The primary function of culture-ware issues is to distract from class war issues. And they also just happen to not care about the people that are caught in the crossfire of those culture-ware issues. So they can lose all of them because the time spent fighting is the win condition. But we have to win every single one of them because the win condition for us is protecting our trans brothers and sisters. The win condition for us is protecting all minorities. And that leaves us in a very difficult spot. It leaves us in a spot where we want to focus on the real issue, class war. The fact that millions and billions and billions have seen billions of dollars out of the pockets of America and the global south for the past 70 years. But instead, we have a comparably small group of agitators consistently punching down. And we need to protect the people that are being punched at. And the answer is never to say, yeah, let's just let them punch them. Because that also loses us the ability to have class solidarity. And how to solve this issue changes in different contexts and different dynamics, et cetera. But I just want you, whenever you are faced, with a fascist that is obsessed with a culture-ware issue, a fascist that is obsessed with trans people using bathrooms, know that this is the dynamic that's functioning behind it. And that is why the right media is so fluid in what culture-ware issues they do. They don't care. I mean, some of them do maybe interpersonally care about winning one or two issues. But the function of it is not winning. The function of it is distraction. And if you go into it with that mindset, at the very least, you don't waste your internal energy being like, fuck, are they right? No, they don't care if they're right either. You shouldn't.",

    "text": "APEC is a part of American imperialism. I'll say that again. It lobbies for the interests of the American Empire. It is not an external force influencing the American Empire to do precisely what it wants to do anyway, but it is a way, the capitalist and imperial class, right? The billionaires and millionaires, communicate with the government that that is what is in their interests. And I can prove this, because the vast majority of funding for APEC comes internal of America. The vast majority of money they receive is American citizens, billionaires and billionaires. And they work in close connection to organizations like KURI, Christians United for Israel, which actually have a similar level of direct lobbying funding, while APEC has a much larger branch of campaign funding. And this is so important, because people often point to APEC funding as a justification for the idea that Israel is controlling America. But that is not true. First of all, APEC, however disgusting and however illegal its collaboration with the Israeli government is, is primarily an agent of the American ruling class. And the more important thing to say about it then is why the ruling class thinks it is a valuable asset, not why a comparably small country with a comparably small economy, with limited influence in the world, is supporting it illegally. And once that's understood, once it's understood that it's actually a communication device between the elite and the government, it becomes much more clear what Israel is, which is just an outpost of the American empire. It's not much special. It serves very similar a purpose as Taiwan, or as South Korea, while having a slightly less complete genocide as those countries or as America itself, and slightly more potent enemies. So please for the love of God, stop suggesting APEC is controlling America. APEC, along with all the other lobbies that we allow to influence what we call the government, is just a portion of the American government because the American government is an oligarchy. It is a way the oligarchs organize. And what it is expressing is that Israel and support for Israel is in the interests of the oligarchs, which is completely distinct from what is in the interests of the American people. And yet that is because America is not a democracy.",

    "text": "James Tauriko is not the propelstein candidate, y'all. He's accepted multi-million dollar donations from a billionaire Zionist. He's reaffirmed Israel's right to exist while committing a genocide, and he has never recognized the genocide. And this is something Blue Maga is absolutely correct on. There is no perfect candidate, but my question to them is why are you so damn proud of that? And what are you doing to prevent it? Because leftists are obsessed with building power, and knowing, famously, what is to be done. And the conclusion of that is that politics does not start or end in the voting box. We can have a discussion about that, but the way we choose which candidates end up in the voting box is largely a product of external pressure, and then the way they act in office is also a largely a product of external pressure. And if we are merely responding to that external pressure, responding to, oh, so many Texans are anti-prolestine. Okay, we can respond to that, but we also need to be changing it. And that is why I, as a leftist, consistently and habitually advocate, mutual aid, community building, tenants organizing, and union organizing, all of which is alive and well throughout America, including surprise, surprise, Texas. These are the working class powers that will change the duopoly. And all I want is a frank discussion about that theory of change, but that is physically not possible if we cannot recognize the things we want to change. If your response to me saying Jasmine Crockett is pro-Israel, and James Tarrico is pro-Israel, which he is, is there's no better option, you don't want that to change. Rather than saying great what's to be done about it, and boy can I tell you, because every single blue mangeau person in my comments, every single blue mangeau person in my stitches, every single blue mangeau person making theme pieces on this, I don't think cared to ask a leftist what should be done. Because very few leftists start and end with not voting. Almost every single leftist I've spoken to is deeply involved in the community that they want to change, at least when they're not just online. And that theory of change is very clear, build working class power to affect politics inside and out of electoral realism. So if you're interested, I can go on forever about that, but I need you to be interested first, because all of them are fucking evil, and if we can't agree on that, we can't even begin to change it.",

These thrive on social media and they all share the same weird pattern. Almost all of these posts aren't English. So who's actually saying this stuff? Let's take a closer look. Notice something? They're overwhelmingly white westerners. In fact, one of the biggest Japanese far-right accounts on X recently exposed and it isn't Japanese at all. It's a British guy pretending to be Japanese and hovering over all this is Elon Musk regularly boosting the Japan's collapsing narrative to his hundreds of millions of followers. So what's going on here? Why is the western far-right so obsessed with Japan? Well, Japan has long been mythologized in white supremacist spaces as this pure, homogenous nation, when people, one culture, untouched by the outside world. Today, Japan's population is shrinking. Immigration is rising and suddenly the country has become a symbolic battleground for these groups. In their minds, the west has already fallen and Japan is the last stand. Yes, it's true. Japan has long been part of the global imperialist system. On immigration, it stands apart from other countries like it, but here's the reality. With foreigners making up just a mere 3% of the population, these invasion narratives are simply manufacturing a problem that isn't there. And that's useful because it shifts the blame away from Japan's real issues. Economic stagnation, renewed militarization, and the lingering footprint of US power in the country. And that's the point. This isn't about Japan at all. These weird westerners have no real connection to or understanding of Japan, who use it as a symbol in their culture wars. And every bit of fake news becomes proof that Japan is supposedly falling. Except, it's not.",

    "text": "If Israel did not exist, America would create an Israel. And that is why all of your critiques of Israel should start with an understanding of the place they play in Western imperialism. Because if it does not, it will lead to a necessarily unhelpful analysis. And this is a truth that every imperialist understood, Joe Biden, Henry Kissinger, and Kamala Harris, understood that Israel serves a vital role in serving American imperial interests of destabilizing and conquering portions of the Middle East. Understanding the threat that things like pan-Arabism and even Muslim unity have to American and hegemony as a vital third power block. And this is why it is so frustrating when I see people hyper-hyper-hyper-focused on Israel as if that's the only Israel in the world. Guys, hear me out. Taiwan is an Israel for China. South Korea. Israel. Just as South Vietnam was in Israel. All of these things were founded by genocide, funded, and supported by the predominant hegemonic empire to serve the interests in that region. Because we don't have to win, we just have to make damn well sure that people don't have sovereignty over their own land so that corporations can come in and try and win. And what happens when you don't recognize that this is not a new game or that this has been repeated over and over and over and over and over again is that you get focused on the specifics. And in this case, the specific that people love to get focused on is that Israel claims to represent the Jewish people. And they anti-Semitically conflate Judaism and Israelism. And when you see that perverse ethno-nationalism that really does do harm and disgusting things coming from a specific group instead of seeing for what it is, which is a actual general political tool of neo-fascists. Like Ben Gavir and Benjamin Ngyahu and Donald Trump. You see it is a particular issue of that particular nationality. And the second we stop seeing it in the general and start seeing it on a specific, small group of people, that is when you get into neo-fascism. Because instead of focusing on the overarching imperial and capitalistic system that caused this, you focus on the much easier but much less helpful critique of an individual group of people. When the only individual group of people that are actually doing it is the multi-billionaires upholding capitalism. So please stop, focus on what it is. It's not just Israel. It's capital. If Israel didn't exist, America as an avatar of capital would make one.",

    "text": "Does Jasmine Crockett take A-Pack money? Because videos like this keep claiming that. I'm in Crockett does not receive a single A-Pack dollar, not a single A-Pack dollar. I don't know. Neither of them take A-Pack money. But this claim while literally true is deeply dishonest. Because while yes, she took zero dollars from A-Pack, she did take a sponsored trip to Israel, funded by the American Israel Education Foundation, totaling over $20,000, and if you just literally look at their one-page website, by the way, Sketch as Hell, it is the charitable organization affiliated with A-Pack. It's right there! And some of the very first words is that they are affiliated with A-Pack. And for those of you who don't know how charitable donations work, the reason you would want to do this is because you get different tax benefits for giving to a super-pack, right, a political action committee, and a 501-C3 educational firm. So what A-Pack has clearly done is set up a 501-C3 to fund things like trips that can be classed as educational, but serve their lobbying of pro-Israel interests, one of which is what Jasmine Crockett went on. And the first video makes a good point, which is that it purers we moving the goalposts when we just recognize that this is just as much of part of the Israel lobby as A-Pack is. But that's an issue from the very first question. We should stop asking if you take A-Pack money. We should start asking if you take money from the Israeli lobby, of which the American Israel Education Fund clearly is. And the second one, saying that James Tarrico and Jasmine Crockett's positions on Israel roughly similar, is vaguely true. They both obviously don't call for a unilateral arms embargo, or for us to, you know, actually invade the genocidal state to prevent the genocide. But we cannot have that discussion where there was reasonable disagreement when we were starting with flagrant disinformation. It is not true that Jasmine Crockett has not taken any money from the Israel lobby, while it is literally semantically true that she took no money from A-Pack. She got as close to that as conceivably possible. And as a final point, there are a lot of people saying that if you are not in Texas, you should not be talking about this. But every single national or state office in the American Empire is fair game for every single person in the world to talk about, because the American Empire is a hegeomotic imperial force that will bomb you. The bills that Jasmine Crockett voted on led to Palestinian children dying. So if I, as an American, whose tax dollars that she helped choose go to genocide, can't say it, how can the Palestinian children who died from it, how can their parents have a say? Of course they get a say. So yes, let's have an honest discussion. Let's have an honest discussion about how racism affects this race. That's have an honest discussion about whether James Taurico, like kind of an institutional lib is any better. But let's not open with disinformation, because it is not helpful. Both of these people are clearly open Zionists. And we can have a discussion about the tactical consequences of that. I condemn both of them unilaterally, and so should you. But you know what? If I was in Texas, I might vote for one of them, just as I did Kamala Harris.",

    "text": "The most effective shit you can do to protest Starbucks is go and use their bathroom. Pun mildly intended. Because boycotting is fantastic, but costing the corporation money is like a lot better. And those in many spaces are legally required to be public bathrooms. So they may ask you to leave and you probably should if they ask, but most of that time they won't, because most of the employees don't give a fuck. And this applies to most boycotts. It is almost always better to not only give them no money, but in some way cost them money, either by posting about this and harming their advertisement, or doing things that I can't advocate online, or like doing very tacit, normal attacks, go into their app, put in a checkout, and don't complete it. That costs the money because it costs them labor. That's true of Amazon as well, by the way. That's why they limit checkout times. So if you're trying to put pressure on a company, it doesn't end with a online boycot campaign. It starts with a online and in person pressure campaign. And we can be a lot more creative about how we put pressure on these places, because they are creative about how they put pressure on us.",

After a year and a half of unemployment, I've decided to take things into my own hands, and yes, I'm going to try and become a content creator full time. In 2026, I will be launching a handful of projects, and I'm very excited about each and every single one of them. The thing is, I want my community to be the ones deciding what they see. On YouTube, I'll be doing weekly videos based off the news that came out that week, and what's important to me, but also what's important to you. If you go to my Instagram page and click on the highlight that says Community Box, you can submit ideas for news topics that you want me to talk about. Also in the Community Box, it's a chance for you to share good news about Palestine, because I'm sick and tired of just seeing horrendous news on my feed. So, every single week, we're going to highlight some of the best things that happened about Palestine and in Palestine, because we all need to smile a little bit, and Palestine is filled with joy. It's not just the awful stuff, and then there's the newsletter. Launching a newsletter called Encestral Currents, and that newsletter is all about the journey of reconnecting with your roots and your heritage. The cool thing about this newsletter is not just my work. Ideas to bring together voices from all over the world, all different sorts of perspectives about what it's like for people reconnecting with their heritage. That's why I want people to submit their own writing, whether it's poetry, or essays, or reviews, or cultural analysis. If you've recently been on a journey of figuring out where your family comes from, what your heritage is, and what it looks like to be connected to it, I want to hear from you. The link to the sub-sack is on my website, and you can go to the about page there to submit your work or pitch work that you'd like to write about. And last but certainly not least, I'm also launching an advice column. Having been doing this community work and organizing for a little while now, I want to be able to offer advice to people who are struggling talking about Palestine to their friends or their family, or wanting to know how they can get organized, and what they can do to make a difference. But if you need advice on any of that, also go to my Instagram page, go to the community box, and there's a section for you to submit questions for advice that you might need. I've been thinking about this for a long time, and the time for thinking is over. I'm ready to act. People like Nick Fuentes and Aaron Parnas can make a living being the dickheads that they are, then why can't I? If you want to support my work, subscribe to me on YouTube or sub-stack, or buy me a coffee, all the links around my website. Thank you, bye!",

It doesn't have a real history. The history of Israel is the history of the settler colonizers, and they reject that history because it makes them look bad. The exact same thing, Rhodesia did, by rejecting that, oh, guys, this isn't white people slaughtering brown people, this is why people modernizing and bringing up the people that live there, and verbatim, the exact same thing that America does.

I don't care if you agree. I will shit on you, publicly, often, if you do it. You can be anti-Semitic in your own mind by yourself. But the second you do something that vaguely looks like anti-Semitism, I'm gonna call you out and tell you I apologize. And by the way, I expect every single one of my mutuals to do the exact same thing. Because this is not a drill, this is not a test, this is not like overwokeism, you should be overly woke. And this also isn't even triggered by a certain thing. I've seen this happen so many times. So please, for the love of God, we need to put up a social barrier to any and all form of anti-Semitism. And if that means you will get to woke, you get to fucking woke.",

Or more so, what's your bar for trusting in Israeli leftists? Someone who calls for Netanyahu to leave, someone who calls for an end to the occupation? Or someone who dodged the draft of the IDF and went to prison for it? Because I think we all kind of hopefully within this generation understand a natural disease with trusting Israeli leftists who call for anything less than the full, unconditional recognition of the Palestinians, right to self-determination in all of that land. And hopefully have some blood in the game. And that exact same logic is how a lot of black and brown leftists approach white leftists and white leftists approach liberals, where we are immediately distrustful because we've seen a lot of people like that act poorly. I'm sure this is quite a common feeling because there's always someone to the left of us, there's always someone with a worse lived experience than us. So the next time you feel rejected from that, rather than interested, try and think about how you treat people to the right of you because it's probably very similar. You probably have a standard that you're willing to work with or you find trustworthy and a standard that you don't.",

And the reason it doesn't feel like politics to you is because how you, as well as I, were raised to think about politics as a fun little conceptual game where we disagree about complex implementations of complex policies and there's genuine analytical disagreement. But we all ultimately walk away happy. And suddenly, you're realizing for the vast majority of Americans, that's not what politics is and it never has been. But you're just entering that vast majority. Politics is actually everywhere. The decision of how you engage with almost any other person on a high level, on a pattern, on a system is political in some way. And we don't need to be rejecting more and more things from being political, especially not when it's more and more evil things. Because Trump's fissistic policies are political and they are particularly evil because they are so. It serves absolutely no one but your fragile understanding of a liberal politic with the two sides basically agree but maybe have some different agreements analytically to reject it as political. So please stop saying this. The better way to say it is that's a fucking disgusting politic. Here's why.",

Lower tax A tax and wealth advisory fund based out of Cyprus and the UAE. In 2022, Norway raised the wealth tax by 55% and they increased the capital against tax to 38%. I honestly hope that this will increase tax money, but what actually happened is the complete opposite. The wealthy... Ah yes, the complete opposite. The tax revenue got so much lower. See that big ass red spike right there? That's 2022, where there was no change in the proportion that paid wealth tax and a massive increase in the average wealth tax. He goes on to note that they rightly so implemented an expatriation tax for billionaires that made their money in Norway, leaving trying to steal that money from the Norway taxpayer, and just kind of laughs at it because he is working for the wealthy, but he never shows the numbers on tax revenue collected because they go against his claim. And most clearly what goes against his claim is my friend. If high-earing taxes doesn't work, why do you who work for wealthy people want it to be lower? Is it because they're gonna have to pay it at some point? Yeah, it is. Just remember, your interests and the interests of the wealthy are the exact opposite. So if a avatar of the wealthy like this guy who can't even memorize his script is reading off reasons for you to go fuck yourself, maybe remember that you don't have to.",

Because if we engage in analysis of the material conditions even vaguely to understand our politics, it simply doesn't make sense that a small country with a small population and generally falsified industries controls one of the largest most implacful empires in this century. But the opposite is much more true, which is that the people that are aiming to expand and maintain that empire might support that country because it acts as an avatar of destabilization and is a strong imperial outpost. That's in line with almost every Marxist and Lennonist analysis of imperialism. And so we can talk about Apex unlawful collaboration with the state of Israel, but the state of Israel was also largely made up of Americans or American sympathizers. I mean, Benjamin Netanyahu was born in the United States of America. So even the delusion that they could be a separate entity that is controlling America is feeding into Israeli propaganda and makes you rife and very prepared to bite hard on anti-Semitic propaganda, which leads you away from being a leftist and being a fascist. If you're taken on Israel is that it's controlling us and that we need to side with the fascists to take it out. Am I am sorry, my friend, you're not a leftist. You fall in for the Mussolini trick of taking socialists and making them care about race in a bad fascist way, not in a cool woke way. So yeah, stop saying this shit. Stop saying Zog. Stop saying, say the obviously correct thing, which is that America is controlling Israel. Israel is a outpost of America. And the influence that we see of Israel having in America is much more better understood as Israel being in the interest of the American Empire, which by the way, it largely is because the American Empire relies on anti-established rest of the world.",

    "text": "See, this is what regular people don't get. You can't just tax rich people more because rich people are not... Hi, regular person here, and I get it. Well, if in tax-cute soltents like this person are obsessed with convincing you that taxing wealthy people, you're just too dumb to understand why it's a bad idea. And then, condescendingly explain to you, the tax code that the rich people wrote, that they avoid. Which, very quickly, is the earn, borrow, die cycle. Because what is taxed in this current economy is income. So if you can avoid ever taking income, you don't pay taxes. And so you get the money that you live with by having your assets say it's stocks, I think like a mortgage. And so you have $100 million worth of stocks, so you get $10 million in a loan, you use that to live. And you go, how do we pay that back? You don't. You die. And then the person that inherits your $100 million worth of stocks sells off those stocks and pays back the debt. And you're saying, well, surely you have to pay for the profit that you earned from those stocks. No, because there's this thing called stepped up asset rates. Which means that if you gain something from an inheritance, you don't pay capital gains tax on it that you typically would. I eat that rich person bought it at $100 sold it to the thousand. They would pay tax on those $900. But if the rich person buys it at $100 dies when it's at a thousand, I get it at a thousand and sell it. I pay no taxes because according to the law, I owned it at a thousand. That's a loophole. That's that's that's called the step up tax loophole. These people presented as like such complicated ideas that we just can't undo it. It's so complicated. There's no way to make a tax code. But you can literally just get rid of stepped up assets or directly tax the asset. As wealth. That's what the unrealized gain tax proposal was. And this is doing two things. First of all, it's putting money in their pockets. Most of these people either are wealthy and benefit from it or work for the wealthy and benefit from helping them avoid tax. And number two, in more kind of epistemically, it is confusing power with truth. They are observing that the people in power have made the tax system such that it doesn't apply to rich people and confusing it with the truth that somehow taxes could never hit reach people. Which is just not true. And they do this a bunch of times, making up the fantasy of the lafarker of which suggests that if you tax people, they just leave or they'll do less economic activity, not true, demonstrably untrue. But it doesn't matter because their goal is to convince you that taxing rich people is literally impossible or against your interest. Which it's not. Taking money from the people taking money from you because the biggest form of theft in this country is wage theft will always be in your interests. And you know how I know that? Because it's not in their interests. They wouldn't be working so fucking hard on lowering the tax code if they weren't going to pay the taxes. You see what I mean?",

It is that that triggers that, because when they have to accept that as their reality, they have to change their opinion. And so the cognitive dissidence sets in. Suddenly it's a special word that needs to be protected, rather than a word that needs to be actually applied to learn from history. Suddenly the only way to respect the memory is to ignore the things happening right now, as opposed to respect in the memory by attacking the things that are very similar to it. The sensitivity is closer to ignorance than to critical engagement. And that is not logical, it never was logical. It is an emotional response to seeing shit that scares you. And that's understandable, but not an accurate political argument. We will never overuse the word Nazi in a country tweeting 14 word tweets all the time.",

Regardless of what you think of the new regime, this should not be surprising. Israel helped them overthrow Bashar al-Assad. Of course, this former al-Qaeda member who suddenly became a sweetheart of the West will bow down to Western and Israeli interests. DUR! The Israeli regime is weak. America wants Middle Eastern regimes to be weak so that they can allow more destabilization and more fucking power in the Middle East. And Israel is very much the avatar of that. So minor concessions, Israel, which they are minor, they're pretty significant for Syria, but in the world, they're comparatively minor, are there two destabilized Syria, because the scariest thing to America and Israel is a powerful united Middle East. And one of the ways they do that is by keeping up pressure so high that one of the only ways that governments can function in the Middle East is by having authoritarian dictatorships, right? Think Bashar al-Assad thinks that I'm who's saying. Or they get overthrown and have a super weak regime. America is not mad at any of these authoritarian regimes we have taken down. That is exactly the goal. Either they want an authoritarian regime that they can control Jordan, Saudi Arabia, or they want one that they can use as a bogeyman, the Ayatollah, Saddam Hussein, Bashar, or they want a fund and support rebels to take down that dictator and then take over the very weak regime following it, which is precisely what we did in Syria.",

While Trump attacks Somalis at home, the US military is still carrying out little strikes in Somali itself. These are the strikes that have killed children, have put families and pushed thousands to flee. Washington calls it counterterrorism. And when they force people to flee that violence, they treat them as garbage. This pressure on Somali communities in the US comes just as Trump uses last week's shooting of two national guards, soldiers in Washington DC, to sell a harder immigration crackdown. It's calling for reverse migration of legal immigrants, even though the shooter was a CIA link theft and operative. And now I see mobilizing about one hundred officers from across the country for a major arrest operation in Minnesota's 50th District, home to one of the largest Somali communities in the US.",

And this has been nowhere clearer than in South America, where along with Trump obviously any legally bombing Venezuelan vessels and illegally clearing Venezuelan airspace and gearing up to invade it, South America as a whole is gearing to get closer to Israel. With the American installed regime of Miele in Argentina pushing American imperialism even further, or the American installed a maintained dictator and al-Savador, maintaining and strengthening relationships with Israel. If it was not already clear with Trump's manufactured consent for war in Venezuela and generally the rest of Central America, the American empire is making a play and making a strong quick and fast one for South America. And they will make up a million excuses for this, just as they did previously for the Iraq war, also predicted by Israeli influence. And this has two points. First of all, that Israel is an expansion of the American empire, not the other way around, even leftists get that wrong sometimes. And second of all, that a focus for the American empire is no longer projecting world-wide power, because Trump is very clearly giving up on that, but becoming a very, very powerful nation among other powers. Marco Rubio has recognized this that we will be in a multipolar world, and this is not notably better, but it does hopefully contextualize what their aims will be. Because the focus will be on bringing the American empire home and local, the massive expansion in the ice-funding and in general brutality of the domestic police, is that bringing the American empire home, and then bringing it locally is the expansion in Venezuela. If the American empire is able to expand its influence in South America, that means you will be able to fund more and more brutality locally, so we must fight it at tooth and fucking nail.",

Because even I want you to think about the concept of Homeland Security, it was a department founded following 9-11 and has almost uniquely been weaponized against Arabs and Muslims. It is a normalizing department that should not exist and only exists once America thought it had a homeland, i.e. a very fascistic concept of a certain people's first certain place to protect. And now Trump is merely bringing that to its logical conclusion, which is that if there are certain peoples for a certain place, then anyone that is not part of those peoples must be taken out of that place.

He cites later in that video, support that bootlicking statement, and he explains that this green thing should basically be ignored, because it was basically during COVID, which fine, why ignore this one? Because that bar is higher, forgive me if I'm wrong, than that one. And that was under Obama. And that was under Clinton. A Democrat. Regardless, removals, returns, enforcement returns, administrative returns, and Title 42 expulsions are all inherently violent and engaged with and funded at massively increasing rates by every single administration. Because here's another more important graph, which is Icent CBP funding. They maybe have different policies of how to use this Gestapo, but every single one of them is interested in funding it. I'm sure you can flip the numbers however you want. And I actually agree that maybe a lot of Democrats, Border Patrol policy, was less brutal. But that is notably less important than number one, the fact that all of them were extremely brutal. And number two, the framework that is enabling this brutality under Trump was created and is still supported by Democrats. I don't think conservatives have a stone to fucking throw, but you shouldn't be defending the Gestapo funding fucking fascists that are going in blue.",

Make the story how to beat that fascist. Because that is the story of the AIDS epidemic, not the government coming to rescue gay and queer people, but queer people coming to rescue gay and queer people. Because the first responders to the AIDS epidemic was never the homophobic Reagan era government, but queer and specifically lesbians who came and did mass blood drives for their gay brothers and sisters. It was queer communities that came together to support especially gay men who often were overwhelmingly transphobic or misogynistic. Because we keep each other safe, the fascists don't, and we need to keep each other safe so that we can fight them. So while it is unfortunate they are being more and more open about their homophobia, transphobia, and general lack of interest in us living. There is no reason to mourn that more than celebrate it, because that is simply them being more honest. And our focus should be what it always has been, which is how to beat the thing they are being honest about, which is a complete disinterest in queer people living.",

That is because political violence is built into our politics. Every bomb we send overseas, every time we celebrate a veteran, we're celebrating political violence.

For example, Trump literally passed a anti-Christian bias executive order trying to root out the well-known anti-Christian bias of the United States government, which famously waged war on Iraq as a crusade. Yes, that government famously anti-Christian guys. And then anti-Christian bias is literally the ideology behind anti-sum rights litigation, like the, oh, I hate gay people so much, I don't want to make a wedding cake for them. Supreme court case. They have to make up social delusion that Christians are the one being oppressed rather than by and large the ones oppressing to justify their political choices, and then eventually their legal arguments. And this nonsense, which is like not only did you write an essay about it, but the essay proved the point, is part of that. So like we can yell at them that it's silly as much as we want, but that won't solve the issue, which is they probably don't believe it either. It's just necessary to getting their political aims done.",

Nothing because you don't actually take your own position seriously. If you genuinely believed that the loss of a fertilized egg's life was the most significant tragedy in this world, which you then say later demeaning the Holocaust, the focus would not be on the vast minority of loss of pregnancy, which is voluntary, but the vast majority of loss of pregnancy, which is entirely natural. But it's not because the actual movement is actually about controlling women. The only difference between the natural and unnatural loss of pregnancy is your blame for the sin of abortion. But actually, one is a lot more preventable. You can do a lot of things to increase implantation rates, but we don't because it's not that important. And you don't because your movement isn't about saving children as you perceive them. But it's about controlling women.",

The engine of the civil rights movement and why it ended up happening was the direct action and effective community resistance of organizations like the Black Panthers. Right, like there's a lot of whitewashing that goes down this, also deserves a total episode. But what it fundamentally was is a decentralized effective resistance and public effort campaign that capitulated to liberal reforms. Right, like the Civil Rights Act was a liberal reform that was an exchange of all of the energy and actual direct action that the civil rights movement had. It wasn't a liberal movement that changed within the liberal framework. So this history of non-electoral, effective direct action and resistance is long in the South.",

They don't want the settler America to be undone. And if anywhere a Haitian revolution is going to happen, it's fucking like Louisiana. Right. Where is majority black and brown and it is extremely repressed. And so if they don't take all this anger of extreme repression, the violence that is an act will be greater and the counterinsurgency will be less, right? The Democrats who are counterinsurgent will be less. And the necessary conclusion there is the grassroots and community defense organizing will be higher. And that's exactly the conclusion that is supported by this illegal invasion, right? The Dems didn't show up not really to say you should vote for us more, right? And this would never happen. They really didn't. Anderson Clayton tried, but no one's listening to her, right? And no one, and if in so far as they did, no one really believed them, right? In the same way like Pritzker in Chicago is saying, well, the Democrats would be nicer. People, some people believe them. If you go watch Chicago, some people are like, where are you, Pritzker? Please let come save us, right? The cries of nonviolence from Libs, which also we saw from the PSL rally on the sideline did not stop people from defending themselves. And actually the nation celebrated when people did defend themselves.

And the confusion makes sense but does matter because top bottom is literally the position you take when you're doing it in bed. Mask them are your gender presentations either in or outside of the bedroom. And Dom sub are king terms. And there is kind of this urge in straight and queer communities to put Dom top mask together and bottom sub them together. And that is literally just recreating gender hierarchies when they don't need to be done. They think about it. The fact that people are conflating the receiving end of intercourse with sub is literally recreating the social construction of a woman. Especially when they add in them there. And even the concept of a femme top being conflated with a person who is more dominant in bedroom is pushing Dom to be conflated with top the giving end in the bedroom. Also you can understand all of those things individually and then you just use them as adjectives. Like it truly is not that complicated and I know it seems silly or overwhelming or like overly woke but there is kind of a hard-edged political reason that it matters. Because we don't want to recreate gender hierarchies in our queer circles.",

Because you don't want to lead with individualism and shame, you want to build community and empathy. Try something like, yeah, I choose convenience all the time and it's hard to give that up. But if you're going to buy Starbucks, why don't you call me next time and we can get coffee together? Why don't we take turns making coffee for each other in the morning, then we can try new things and not buy Starbucks? There are so many ways to instead of returning to things that separate us, judge each other and shame each other. For things we all engage in, right? Like this is mass produced, we all engage in consumerism. We can work to undo and undermine the things that push that consumerism, which is rampant, vitriolic individualism, and a lack of empathy and understanding between Americans. We should not be contributing to the shaming of us as the victims of corporate propaganda of individualism. But we should be contributing to the solution of that, which is building effective proper community. And the quote, boycott against Starbucks is so easy to do that with if we just do it right.",

    "text": "New song in Wicked is the libification of Elphaba, and I can prove it. Spoiler alert, but stick with me because this is genuinely very interesting. This new song, No Place Like Home, basically takes Elphaba's very anarchist and leftist undercurrents of literally being a freedom fighter and pushes it into a liberal ideal of nationalism. That being, instead of nationalism being like what it came from with like Napoleon being like a people, like literally the people of France or whatever, it becomes an ideal, an idea, no longer is America a white subtler colony, right, which is what ethno-nationalist kind of admitted is, they just think it's good. It is an idea, it's a liberal ideal, it's the American dream. And this is explicitly said in this song, Ozz is more than just a place, it's a promise and idea. No, it's not. No, it is not. It is a country made by a fascistic leader. And the name literally comes from the wizard's name, right, like Os' Dynet pre-exist fascism, Os' Dynet pre-exist this nasty nationalism he built. This is the wizard's full name, it's Os' Pinhead. The name comes from Os. Then the song goes on and basically tells the animals don't feel discouraged and resigned when you want to leave. Just remember that Os' belongs to you, there's no place like home. But this is incredibly reminiscent, and I think tellingly so, that nationalism can't really be separated from this like right-wing ideology of like a people for a place, because it sounds a lot like this song from Caperee, which was written like in the aesthetics of fascists, which is tomorrow belongs to me. Tomorrow belongs to me, sounds a lot like Os' belongs to you. And this is only finally proven when Elphaba goes, they need someone to hate. And she's basically encouraging Glinda to continue the hatred of her, right, which is very similar to how fascists hate communists, the evil, undercurrent freedom fighters, to establish Glinda's new regime. And this is very different than like the principled staunch Elphaba that is like, no, they are wrong, it needs to be exposed, this is wrong. And the kind of story arc it takes in the movie is, oh, like she was wrong for wanting the liberation of everyone, she was wrong for wanting her to be liberated and she just accepted the compromise. That is literally what liberalism is. And I know I may be nerding out over this a little too much, but it is something is there, right? Like they did make her a liberal in the film, and the idealization of the nation of Os' belonging to us is so liberal, it's almost intoxicating because it also chose her privilege. Like they, she thinks animals are leaving because they don't realize that Os' belongs to them, animals are leaving because they're facing genocide.",

    "text": "Americans are celebrating Thanksgiving today and all be the buzzkill so you don't have to be. Thanksgiving never happened. It's a myth made up by the white settlers that genocide it enslaved and sold thousands of natives into slavery. There is not even a kernel of truth to this lie made up to justify and glorify the colonizers, other than the fact that in fact the colonizers were too rudimentary and savage to figure out how to form until the land of America. So they did have to eat with the natives who many times graciously fed them and then were met with literal bullets, enslavement and oppression following that. Thanksgiving is a lie made up by the American Empire to whitewash its history of mass genocide and enslavement upon which it is founded. A tradition that maintains today. The myth of us going into World War Two because we just loved minorities so leaving the idea that we're actually against the fascists when we funded literally over 10, 20, 30 fascist regimes in the past 100 years. America is great at lying to itself to suggest that is anything other than a parasitic empire upon multiple nations that we have consistently enslaved, plundered and destroyed. Happy Thanksgiving y'all.",

    "text": "You'll know Elphabas a communist, right? Fascism is defined by anti-communism, and the wizard's regime is defined by anti-Elphabasism, as well as scapegoating of the animals who represent the Jews, because it's a holocaust metaphor. An Elphaba, as the communists were painted to be, wears an ally to the racial minority. Things like Judeo-Borschebism. So if the wizard is fascism, and the animals are the scapegoat, and Elphaba is the ideological contra to the wizard, which is always what fascists point to as communism being, what does that make Glinda? Makes Glinda Liberals. People that are not willing to undermine the anti-communism, right? That is that the core of fascism. But it may be willing to soften the scapegoating racism and vitriolic violence that happens under fascists. And this is exactly what we saw Glinda do, right? She literally was made her regime off of the same hatred of Elphaba, right? Elphaba in the movie says they need someone to hate, and the communist answer to that is, no, they don't. The liberal answer to that is, yes, and let's make it communism, rather. Let's make it an idea, rather, than a given race, religion, or a creed. And she never condemned the hatred of Elphaba. She never agreed with the revolutionary acts that Elphaba took to actually undermine the regime, and she never actually informed people as to why the wizard was bad. In the exact same way de-notsification never happened under liberalism. And I know we all, like, read our own ideology and aims into a given piece of media, and I'm 100% guilty of that, but genuinely argue with me here. Because it is a Holocaust metaphor. It is a rise of ashes of metaphor. The animals are very clearly cast as the racial minority that is oppressed. The wizard is very clearly the fascistic, populist leader. That only leaves so many characters. And the character that took over failed to de-notsify and maintained hatred of the actual freedom fighters that actually freed people. That's liberals. That's America. Right? That's the West. And the people that actually freed people, the partisans, the people that actually took out the Nazis, the people that actually took out the fascists. That's communists. Or anarchists, but in any case, she's both.",

You could look it up. And Trump clearly displays a lot of these beliefs. He's centralizing autocratic government. He believes in being a dictator. He exalts nation and often race over individual. A lot of anti-anti-fascists don't seem to understand that that is the accusation being made. Not just Trump bad, right? And I think this is real because a lot of liberals use fascists to just refer to people who they think are bad. And to be frank, so do a lot of leftists. But no, I think liberals are bad. I think conservatives are bad. I think all forms of racism and bigotry are bad. But they're not all fascists. Specifically, what we mean when we're talking about fascism and why he is particularly the concerning is he is cracking down on opposition. He is increasing domestic militarization. And he is normalizing and expanding white supremacy in America. And to do that, he is using conservative and liberal tools, such as the otherization, alienation, and demonization of minorities. Right? So like conservatives hate minorities too. They just don't have these other things. And Trump is using the conservative ideas of like being against trans people to justify his nationalist and white supremacist ideology.",

    "text": "Have you all seen the Department of Homeland Security's Twitter? Because recently this made it on it, and I hate to say, but yes, we do have to talk about shit-posting of a government agency. Because they posted this after they said Charlotte's web, the cute little name they said for kidnapping people in Charlotte, was over, and they posted a Chad meme. They've also posted shit like this, rents to high millions of criminally-legals, ending with the nice little epithet, many problems, a simple answer, and I just want you to realize, if you replace criminal illegals with any other ethnicity, race, religion, group, this reads as clear and obvious-fascistic propaganda. When in fact, the one group that actually does make the rent too high, the groceries copped too much, not enough jobs, and does actually contribute to unsafety of women as we're seeing with the Epstein files releases, our billionaires, the very people that homeland security is being supported by. And last but certainly not least, it's rocious. They are promoting the Justice Department's recruiting of deportation judges, and the stuff they're doing is define America for generations. How do you think that's going to be read by the white supremacist followers? Hmm? Not deliver justice, also this was made like on Canva or something, losers. But define America, and I don't know if you all have talked to enough white supremacists, but this is what they always say. Like Nick Fuentes says this, we want to keep America America, and now homeland securities engaged in the exact same rhetoric. If you ever want to see just how obvious this current regime is about their white supremacy, just go look at DHS or ISIS Twitter, because maybe when Nazis are talking to you, they're going to put on some faces. When they're talking to each other, or signaling to each other, or trying to recruit each other, they're going to be a bit more obvious. And this is about as obvious as you can get without just straight up doing the salute, which by the way, everyone remember Elon did.",

So I went there with my husband, but next to me, my god, that guy, he was so fine. And at one point I swear to god I think his leg might have brushed next to mine. And that's when I fucking realized that if anyone paid attention to this film, everybody would realize that this was a story about fascism and they would recognize that they also had the power to speak up against the fucking evil people who are lying to everyone about everything in the world. But I think a lot of people are too media literate. So I just want to spell it out for you. Like the way that the Wizard of Oz uses the animals as literal scapegoats to give the people of Oz a reason to blame all the awful things on up until Alphabela arrives. The same playbook that the United States government is using to make people think that queer people and immigrants and Palestinians and Arabs and Muslims are the scapegoats and the reason why everything in this country is going to help. The way that Alphabela fights the entire time to convince the people of Oz that they are being lied to is literally the same way that Palestinians and leftists and anyone who who's actually woken up have been trying to convince the world that they are being lied to by their government. And don't get me started on the way that Glinda thinks that fitting in and going with the flow and like being a part of these systems to try and convince them that you can work fix it from the inside is the representation of how people think that they could fix these systems and the democratic party. Like it can't be any more obvious but the amount of people that are going to go into this movie and walk out not thinking about any of that is just absurd. Half the people that went to go see Wicked walked out of that movie realizing that they are being lied to that their government and the world would be such a better place.",

What they're missing in this is that every compromise was deeply unjust. And the fact that Israel has the power to continue committing more and more and more of violence against the Palestinians doesn't suddenly give the Palestinians an obligation to be quote, reasonable and accept a deeply unjust compromise. Rather, more and more power, if we actually talk about it morally, rather than through the lens of a fascistic despot, gives is real more obligation to use that power responsibly. But when people talk of the language of reasonableness or compromise or, you know, civility, and suddenly the fact that someone has the power to do something evil means they actually have the right to do it, or at the very least that you're stupid for thinking they shouldn't or won't. That is incredibly dangerous, and it's something called epistemic violence. Using the physical, outsized, unequal power that we have in this world to affect the knowledge systems that you accept. It's not an actual argument, right? The more powerful person has no bearing on morals, but you will see it in the conversations you have with Zionists and with white supremacists and with neo-nautis that they just implicitly accept that if they have the power to commit violence, you're stupid for thinking they won't. But suddenly, you think you have an obligation to react to that power in a way that conceives it. But instead, recent to the conversation, not on how to be reasonable or how the victims could reduce harm to themselves, but forcing them to justify why they're doing the violence in the first place.",

If you want to understand and undermine the new fascistic regime, you have to understand how we got here, and the Patriot Act is key to that. Because this act was passed in the wake of 9-11, where the American Empire's ego had been bruised, the American populist was afraid, and the American security infrastructure was excited. And all of those fears came together to justify the murder, unjustified murder, of three to five million people in a rock in Iran, and the Patriot Act. The act that founded ICE gave CBP expansive powers, justified the racialized security surveillance of thousands of innocent Americans, and hid the torture and murder of hundreds. All because Americans were afraid, the American Empire was insecure in the very emotional sense, and the security apparatus was yearning to expand. And so as we see this nationalistic force that found its grip following 9-11 to pull away rights from civilians and justify mass slaughter, we see the core of the Trump fascism, we see the seed. Because Trump's white supremacy, Trump's nationalism, Trump's fascism is very similar. It is built out of a fundamental insecurity, and then a yearning of the American capitalist class to expand and exploit. And that is why we are seeing the exact same agencies that found their start in the Patriot Act like ICE, becoming more and more brutal and more and more racialized. Now, not only is it Americans feeling like God, other countries might be able to do the exact same thing we've done to them, but white people, seeing, oh God, if we become a minority, they might treat us like one, and using the same tools to solve that problem by deporting people racially and terrorize their opponents. So as we go about thinking how to undermine this fascist regime, it may be worth sitting and thinking, how do we prevent another one? Because those seeds are still there, we need to tear them up by their roots.",

This isn't like the anti-antifa stuff, which is fair, but it's just a historical fact that many time fascists hide behind the label of anti-communist to push race and fascist ideology. Historically, the America First Committee of Lindenberg did this very effectively. Bortjelink and Rockwell, in his beginning, did a similar thing. Many famous fascists and neo-Nazis have hid behind this exact same label. Actually, if you ask a lot of people with swastikas on their arm, hey, are you a fascist? They will just say, no, I just really hate communists. So when you see a country that has no threat of communism taking over at all, signaling very hard that they are anti-communist and hate communists and just mourn all the victims of communism, you should be thinking about why they're doing that. It's not because they're actually scared of communism. Once again, there's no chance in hell communists take over in America. It's because the people they're signaling to see what it signals and what it signals is the historical arch-enemy of communists, which are fascists.",

So get in contact with local organizations that are organizing ice watch, get a fucking whistle and learn how to use it. And if you can, and especially if you have privilege, join a community defense organization to defend your neighbors from illegal and vexatious kidnapping. Because this is not about the law, this is not about order, this is not about crime, this is about kidnapping people that are enemies or targets of this regime.

It's the response that feels good and does hit the problem, which is they're confusing the critiques. The critique of A-Cab is not primarily individual. It can be. But the better critique that we should be pushing towards is that cop as a position, as an entity as an organization, is bastardizing and bad. When we get lost in this discussion about hard personal choices, we're not only wasting our time, but we're missing the point. Because just as there is no ethical consumption under capitalism, there's no ethical labor under capitalism and certainly not within empire. And even if you yourself are not a cop, right? You throughout your day do things that contribute to the police day and contribute to the empire. No one hears hands are clean. And the discussion shouldn't be whose hands are not clean enough to come and make a better future. Our discussion should be how do we take these dirty hands and clean them? And so while shaming and degrading cops who get way too much credit for shitty horrible terrorism should be done. That's not my argument. When we are met with the classic and annoying, but this cop had to feed their child or this cop had to join a terrorist group because how else would they make money? Our answer should be, yeah, they're still evil, but also, yeah, we should live in a world where that's not the choice. Yeah, people make hard, bad, sometimes evil or wrong decisions when they are in evil, wrong, bad or evil societies like the American Empire is. It brings people into the discussion rather than excluding them that centers the actual critique and the actual system and problem and actually facilitates better solutions. This is the systemic critique at work that leftists should be in engaging in. But all too often, we take the bait of focusing on a very liberal approach of demonizing and moralizing individuals. That's not leftist at all.",

That's okay, you can just say that. Okay, that's easier. It's easier than explaining it. I don't mind. So what point is anyone going to do anything about this? Like, namely the Democratic Party, who had known for a long time that this man is a fascist. I don't think anyone's going to be doing anything about it because the Democratic Party wants fascism because fascism is literally the only way to make the Democratic Party look good because they refuse to actually move farther to the left to actually help people. They refuse to adopt like socialist policies that actually help our communities. And so instead they want the right to go farther and further and further and further to the right because the farther they go to the right, the better the Democrats look. And don't get me started on the joke that is the United Nations. What is the fucking point of uniting the world together after World War II to be like, we don't want that to happen again. And then you're literally going to watch fascism take over countries again. Like, what the hell? This timeline is so fucked. We're in hell. We're in hell. This is the bad place.",

This is just demonstrably untrue. Israel has been caught time after time, explicitly targeting civilians, in ways that could not even vaguely be justified in self-defense. And that is why they have been rightly accused of committing genocide and committing unlawful occupation. Because no, their violence against the Palestinians is not genuinely self-defensive. It is acts of war crimes by an ethno-state intent on ethnic cleansing. But I don't want to brush past the first point you made, which is it's not killing its defensive. This is what Hasbro propaganda will do. It will first deny the obvious reality, then it will attempt to justify the compromised reality that it accepts. And it is made to waste our fucking time. It is just nonsense to suggest they're not killing civilians, even it admits they're killing civilians. But by making you have to point that out, you're making me, my point, be like, look at this obvious reality, and then you get to make another point. And then we never get to the other lie that you said, which is that it's defensive. So you're not going to stop, so I'm not even going to pretend to educate you. But guys, if you do ever see this, that's what they're doing. Call them out on every single point of bullshit, because they will make about 10 in one breath.",

What international law are you talking about? Don't even have to go from first principles here. This has already been ruled on in the ICJ. The palace in the interitorium, the West Bank, is occupied as well as Gaza. This was ruled in 2024 and explicitly found that the occupation was unlawful. You do want to talk about comparable examples. Here's the continued occupation of Namibia by South Africa back in the 70s. What was Namibia prior to being occupied by South Africa? Not an independent state. We're just lying for one of the most easily debunkable claims international law possible. If you want to say you don't have to follow international law, which seems to be Israel's position anyway, just say that. But don't appeal to something you neither care about nor know about, because it just makes your case worse. No, international law is not vaguely on your side. The ICJ has habitually ruled against you and literally no one believes that that definition of occupation is anywhere in international law. It's just not what it means. It means that a state or force are occupying territory that are not their own. You're dishonest, not confused, so I'm not teaching you. But just in case anyone else hears this nonsensical has per talking point, that's the answer. No jurisprudences on your side. And it's so easily debunkable.",

    "text": "It's come to my attention, many of you don't know what it means to collaborate with ICE. And further, that many of you have an entirely unearned trust of the pigs. So let's break down what exactly it would mean to be a cop that doesn't work with ICE. Quit. It would mean you quit. Because it is not possible to stay a police officer in America and not collaborate with ICE. What police offices mean when they say they don't collaborate with ICE is often that they will not do more than the law requires in their state to do so or that they will not actively participate in immigration raids. Which like, cool, we should pressure police offices as long as they're not abolished to do this. But that is not not collaborating with ICE. That is a marketing scheme to make them seem better when in fact their body can is still subpoenaable by federal agents. Their data they collect on all people, including immigrants, is still accessible by the federal government. And the second they throw them into the jail, the sheriff's office, at least in North Carolina, and in many states, will have to collaborate with ICE. And that's their job to throw people in jail. So their job is to put someone in a fucking place that collaborates with ICE. So let's stop this nonsense. We can use the words they want to use to make them feel good and say, yes, you shouldn't collaborate with ICE, but we should never pretend like the pigs are anything else, but a differently uniformed state terrorist. And they will never, ever be your friend. And if they are assuring you that they hate ICE as much as you do coming into their city, number one, they're lying. And number two, the only reason they would feel that way is because they want to be the ones terrorizing you. That's not amicable. That's not admirable. They will never be your allies. But they can maybe occasionally, very cautionably, be less of assholes to you.",

    "text": "West Bank is currently being overrun with Settler violence. So let's break down what you need to know and why Israel uses this strategy. West Bank settlers are basically private Israeli individuals that go into Palestinian territory and establish settlements. These settlements can be as basic as a tent on top of a hilltop to full established towns. But the important part about this to the Israeli colonial strategy is that it establishes facts on the ground. This has been a system of occupation since Ben Gureon, the first president of Israel. Because the second that they have Israeli settlers in the territory, they can turn around to the international community and say what? You want to ethnically cleanse Israelis from this area? And as long as it is private individuals, Israel doesn't get the full blame apparently for the occupation force that it is. Despite these settlers being trained and often armed by the IDF and certainly being actively defended by the IDF once settlements have been implemented. Settlers are often brutal to Palestinians, not only establishing their own settlements, which they very rarely do comparatively, but actively stealing houses from Palestinians. If a Palestinian leaves for a month or two, they may find West Bank settlers in their territory. Right now, the West Bank settlers are doing a massive offensive as the fascistic government of Israel has given them a massive green light with the E1 plan, which effectively annexes the majority of the West Bank. Further, many of these West Bank settlers are literally armed by American charities, such as multiple New York charities that have been caught doing this, like the one is real fund, which has been caught by remote controlled aerial vehicles for settler militias, contribution for accessories for their guns and tools. Do not be confused, these are not rogue extremists, they are effectively state operatives, who are acting on a function of the Israeli colonial project to establish facts on the ground to facilitate occupation and colonization, and they are massively systemically brutalizing Palestinians right now.",

Performative politics has its place, but marching alongside the pigs that are kidnapping your neighbors through the neighborhoods of people at risk is not only useless. It's dangerous. I understand having to mobilize privileged white people, but the way we do that right now is not by putting the people at risk in further danger. And this is not too talk over the people actually being affected. If you would like to host a parade, very welcome, but I'm speaking to especially white privileged allies, that is not your major call to action right now. And it should not be. If you would like to mobilize, go to any of those organizations I pointed to to learn practical, effective advice at keeping your community safe. And for the love of God, never organize with the pigs that we are fighting against.",

And your school district refuses to offer a perfectly feasible remote option to protect their students. The pigs that claim to serve and protect are facilitating these kidnappings. And the allegedly progressive council members are failing to do anything substantive to protect you. All while ICE terrorists spread across the state and terrorize other North Carolinians. It should not be our responsibility and at this point Jen A's responsibility to show you how the fuck it's done but unfortunately it has become that. So show up and show out don't show up to these pig fucking infested parades people having in central Charlotte find direct intervention protests that are not facilitated by the people kidnapping us. And disrupt all of the gears of fascism from the fucking highways that they are stopping immigrants on to these schools that they are forcing people to come to. They move extremely quick, extremely organized but they are fucking stupid. And so if charlotteans, if southerners, if Carolinians can be half as organized, half as effective and we can be, then we can work against it. Or at least prevent them from being as brutal as they fucking want to.",

Their sheriff very openly said that the sheriff's office and CMPD would be working and collaborating with explicitly ICE and DHS. And across North Carolina police offices are required by North Carolina law to collaborate in some form with ICE. This varies place to place, for example. Raleigh has said they would limit their collaboration to the point of the law. But in Charlotte they have not even done that. CMPD is enabling these kidnappings and brutalities. If you see this misinformation correct it. If you hear it share this. And in general cops will never be your friend. At the very least they are collecting information and systems that will be used by ICE. And at most they are actively either ICE agents or enabling ICE agents. Misinformation about their collaboration and the threat they genuinely pose to vulnerable communities and people is dangerous and will get people kidnapped.",

To the name of the Gaza Stabilization Force, there are once again removing autonomy and self-determination of the Palestinian people in Palestinian land. This resolution passed by the Security Council after Russia and China abstained, powers a Trump-chaired board of peace as a transitional authority, and I would like to remind all of you the Oslo Accords, which are still the ruling accords of the West Bank, were also meant to be transitional 25 years ago. It also calls for a complete disarmament of the Palestinian resistance, but says nothing of denatifying Israel, disarming Israel the aggressor in this case, or ending occupation in the West Bank. Which we should not expect because this is a body headed by Western powers and made to maintain Western interests. We must cease to be disappointed and continue to be angry because they are doing their job perfectly, facilitating a liberal veneer of colonialism over Gaza, over the occupied territories. All, while Trump continues to brutalize people across America, he is continuing the long American tradition of occupying and brutalizing people outside of it.",

If you don't see that this is a distraction, even though it as a substantive issue does matter, you are going to lose this fight. Because this is my bet. The Republicans are going to release a highly redacted, highly limited, Epstein list. The Democrats are going to keep fighting on it and we're going to spend the next four months just talking about the Epstein list as ICE rams sacks the rest of the South as there is no tangible win on healthcare as there is no tangible win on immigration as they consistently brutalize more and more of our neighbors. And even if we do win on this issue, what do we learn that Trump's a rapist that most of these people in power rapists? Who doesn't fucking know that? And it clearly wasn't enough for Trump not to get elected. This matters because of the victims of Epstein and his cronies that is unequivocal and I would never undermine that. There is an important note that it is not being focused on because of them. The Democrats are clearly using this as a distraction to everyone hating them following their government shutdown that they fucked up. Which by the way, it's the Republicans government shutdown too, but the Democrats were fucking useless during it. And the Republicans are perfectly happy to focus on this while they get to brutalize minorities through the rest of the South their favorite pastime. So yes, the Epstein list should be released. Yes, it does matter. But my fucking god, there are thousands of victims being made every single day as ice continues. And it is a fucking failure on astronomical levels to think that this will provide any real justice to the victims of the Epstein cronies. And to ignore the victims being made every single day as this is the focus rather than the thousands of people being brutalized and forced out their homes.",

Multiple activists who have been helping defend their communities have already been arrested, and at least one person has been confirmed shot. Charlotte Mechlerberg Schools has refused to offer a remote option for students or families who may be at risk. CNPD is collaborating directly with ICE and DHS, and there has been no action thus far seemingly from the state. Please share this information, and if you document things, share them at this hotline. You can also contact Carolina Migration Network and see the information they are sharing for bail information, who to call and when, and other organizations you can get involved with to keep your neighbors safe. ICE will not respond to a protest, and the state has already chosen their side. The only people left to keep Charlotte in safe are fellow Charlotteians. So if you can, mobilize, donate to a bail fund, donate to a legal fund, educate your neighbors on their rights if ICE does call, and if you can, follow and document ICE. We need them to know we are watching them. And for further information and training and resources on how to defend your neighbors from the state terrorists, find local organizations willing and capable of doing the radical actions that must be done to keep each other safe.",

And the state and local governments are proving only more that they are unwilling to defend from it, and more than willing to facilitate this fascistic takeover. So it is those you are in community with, and those around you that must take care of each other. So if you are privileged, if you are wealthy, and if you are white and documented in America, get out and mobilize. Join an ice watch, get trained on how to take care of your neighbors, and if you can join a community defense organization, find your power and mobilize. Spread information on the legal rights people have, fund, bail funds, and legal funds for people that are illegally kidnapped by ICE. And if we must engage with the state, do so by pressuring things like your school district to offer remote options so that people who are at risk of being detained by ICE and brutalized by them do not need to take an extra trip. We must never make a parent choose between bringing their children to school and seeing them that afternoon. It has become clear, the only people that will keep each other safe are the communities we are in. So get organized, get mobilized, because that's all we have.",

    "text": "Carlet North Carolina is currently being invaded and brutalized by DHS and ICE. So if ice knocks on your door, here's what you need to know. First, you have a right to remain silent. You do not have to discuss your immigration status with anyone, such as where you're born, whether you're a citizen, or how you entered the country. Second, you have a right not to open the door. Unless officers show you a signed warrant with your name, do not let them in. And make sure that that signed warrant is signed by a judge and is not an ICE administrative warrant. You can look up what that looks like. Make, ask to see the warrant through a window or under the door. Make sure the warrant is signed by a judge. Not ICE. They, you have a right to refuse a search. Say clearly, I do not consent to a search. You have a right to speak to a lawyer. Do not sign anything before speaking to a lawyer. Stay calm and record if it's safe. Document what you see and call the Carolina Migration hotline, which is here. The rule of law in America is dead. ICE is not following the law and we know that. But it remains the first line of defense, but must not be the last. So if you are a privileged citizen in America and you live in Charlotte, don't only speak up, don't only show out, but go get trained as ice watch, join community defense and stand the fuck up for your neighbors. If you want information on how to tap in and keep your neighbors safe as well as you, follow Carolina Migration Network on Instagram and join their rapid response by following the instructions in this link. And importantly, it seems that Raleigh is coming next. So if you are in Raleigh, if you are around Charlotte, if you are in North Carolina, protect our community because we know damn well that the state won't.",

    "text": "We need to talk about the West Bank. Because what's happening there is an escalation of violence that we haven't seen in years. And why is violence being escalated in the West Bank? That is because the settlers realized that if a genocide could be committed against the people of Gaza, what's stopping them from literally killing the families that they want to steal the homes from? A friend of mine is on a protective presence trip in the West Bank right now. It's basically a trip where you sign up with an organization to help the families of the West Bank who are literally just there to be present between the settlers and the families. Because generally speaking for the last few years, your presence and international presence, a foreigner's presence was enough to scare the settlers from not being able to do anything, not attacking people. But the amount of violence from these settlers has increased so much, so that protective presence is doing a lot less good because these settlers don't care anymore that these foreigners are here documenting their war crimes. And my friend is there to help one of the last families in the valley from being kicked out of their land. Because the settlers around them were stalking all the other families and attacking all the other families to the point where it got too dangerous for the families to stay there. At one point, one of the settlers went into the homes of one of the families and strangled a child. That family decided it was too dangerous for them to be there and then they left. That's the whole purpose of why settlers exist in the West Bank. They're there to intimidate, and to scare, and to threaten, and to hurt, and to kill the Palestinians on the West Bank land so that they can build up their settlements and claim it as their own, just like they did with the rest of Israel. The international community, the politicians, the global leaders, they're not doing jack shit about the increase of violence in the West Bank. And they could be doing so much more. All these people that say that what is going on in Gaza is horrible, and that the violence is terrible, and that they should have done something or whatever, right? They could be doing something right now to help the Palestinian families in the West Bank. But do they? No. So you all, all of you, need to pay more attention to what is happening in the West Bank, because it is literally the only thing keeping those Palestinians from being killed. Your attention, the world's attention on the West Bank. So if you haven't been following anyone that has been talking about the West Bank, all to add a couple of the people that I know doing incredible work, documenting, and talking about what's going on in the West Bank in the comments. And as much as protective presence isn't doing as much good as it was before, it still works when the rest of the world is aware of what's going on. And as my friend continues her protective presence trip in the West Bank, I will try to also update you all about what's going on with that family, because everybody needs to be aware of what's going on. And as always, you know, I guess, do the like, comment, subscribe thing, whatever. Bye.",

Wait, if they're irrational, why are we punishing them? This is kind of the second step of the conversation, where we realize that prisons don't exist to punish you or I, as we conceive of ourselves, and thus we need a secondary class of people that we think prisons do justify. But I want you to take that very seriously as well. If it really is only for irrational people, if prisons only exist because some people are so wild and irrational that otherwise they would commit crimes, do you think these irrational people will sit in their mind and go, I need to commit this crime because I have any rational urge to do so? Is it worth doing so for 20 years in prison? No, they're not going to do that because you are positing that they're irrational. It's just logically incoherent, right? Consider there are people who damaged. Maybe they're so damaged, they don't consider the punishment. Have you thought of that? No, it's because these are not coming from first principles. You didn't start. I see irrational, totally wild, totally unpredictable people in society. Ah, we need a punitive justice system. You saw a punitive justice system and were taught that it was good, and now you need reasons to think it is good. But it's not. It's not justified. Punitive justice systems don't really make sense, and they don't actually respond to why crime happens. And this is why I offer that a much better understanding of crime is not working backwards from justifying a punitive justice system, but working forwards and asking criminals why they committed the crimes, and then trying to prevent those reasons from coming into existence in your society in the first place. And very quickly what you realize is criminals, by and large, don't commit crimes because they like, are these wild, like, what the movies will show as psychopaths. They are very real people who had very real reasons, and often reasons wildly out of their control that led them to make very hard decisions. Is this true for everyone? No. Am I justifying every action? No. But we don't need to justify it to actually be interested in ending it.",

And the much better way to communicate about this is, yes, Palestine is despicable. And the American Empire and its allies are also harming people in Sudan. And in Congo, and if we want to help the Palestinian struggle, we have to understand the Sudanese and Congolese struggles. But instead of bringing these struggles together, like they actually are, what this does is pits them against each other. And makes all of the movements less effective. If the Sudanese struggle is placed in combatancy, in opposition to the Palestinian struggle, they have to work against each other before they can work against the oppressor. And I don't know who commented this. It could be someone who's been very good-father, very bad-father. But there is a reason that Zionists and Zionist body counts, you hear this exact same thing from. And that is because they know that it undermines actually effective liberatory movements. They know that it is distracting, and they know that it will instrumentalize some of you to also be distracting. So if you feel called to make a similar comment, or you get a comment like this on your video, or a written response to a comment you make, just try to reform what you're saying. Yes, there is racism. Yes, there is, like, imperial bias in why people aren't talking about Congo or Sudan. And that deserves to be called out. But also, it is important to be able to bring together the liberatory struggles, so they are actually effective. And this does the exact opposite of that. And in many ways, it plays directly into the hands of the people we are working against.",

And I'm not saying it's justified, but I am saying that the logical consequence of that is that punitive justice does literally nothing, and if anything makes it worse. Because if they're one-time offenders and likely to remain that way, punishing them doesn't prevent a further murder. And if it is for personal or economic reasons, the clear obvious answer is to help them build better personal or economic relationships, which is facilitated not by locking them away from a support net, right? But actually providing a better community and better social safety net to them. And this is why every copaganda film doesn't focus on one-time murderers or a huge portion of the women offenders who are killing their abusive husbands, but they focus on this very legitimately very small minority of murders that are mass and typically clinically mentally ill in some way, form or fashion. But even, I really want you to think about that as well, because if someone like Jeffrey Dahmer does having a punishment prevent Jeffrey Dahmer from continuing, no, because he's doing it for like physiological and psychological needs, he's not going, I will only spend 20 hours or 20 days or 20 years in prison. Therefore, this is like, that's not how people work. So on no construction, even the falsified made up copaganda construction of human beings do punitive justice systems really make sense. And the way I prove this to everyone is going, would you if the justice systems in exist, go out and murder someone? Okay, if you would, why? And what could we do to prevent that? If not, welcome to the 99% that wouldn't. Who do you think are in the 1%?",

    "text": "The purpose of cops is to enforce the law. Why are they overwhelmingly more likely to commit domestic abuse? Why are they much more likely to be murderers or rapists themselves? I don't mean that rhetorically, I want you to genuinely think about it. Does it make more sense that law enforcement officers' genuine job is law enforcement, but they just happen to be more violent, or does it make sense that their actual job is brutalizing minorities, brutalizing whatever the underclass of the given place is, and then their continuing their job at home? Because to me, one track's a lot better than the other. If their genuine goal as police, as a system of police, was to enforce the law, surely that would be their value set. Right? The reason I do this work is because I believe in it. Surely you would imagine that they do that work because they believe in it. But if you think their purpose is to brutalize minorities, they go from brutalizing black and brown people on the street, to brutalizing women at their home, that naturally tracks. And so I think it is very serious that we go from being astonished or disgusted or terrified of cops failing at their job at home, to understanding that they are actually extraordinarily successful at their job at home or outside, or when they put on their KKK ropes. Because it has always been their job to brutalize minorities, and that is why we must abolish the police.",

My friend, that's what happens when you trust corporations to feed you. What's left after the government fails? Corporations? Who's not feeding you? The corporations! This reminds me a lot of this meme, where it's like they are pointing to socialism in practice, and then it's just literally capitalism. Like, my man, do you not realize that it's not the reliance? That is the problem. It is the failure to feed them, that is the problem. Like, everyone on Snap, including the majority of the people on Snap that are either single parents, children, or elderly, would very much like to feed themselves, but I don't see Google going in and giving the money. I don't see Apple going in and giving food to children. So yeah, unfortunately, it has to be the state that is feeding them, and we would all be a lot better off if the workers made enough money, like they would in socialism rather than having it stolen by the corporations to feed them themselves.

    "text": "So being Palestinian and having empathy for Palestinians requires you to live in a constant state of pain, in grief, in sorrow, and horror. And so I think a lot of people just want to avoid it, which is fair, but also like I hate it when people tell Palestinians to stop looking at the news. Or is to not not be caught up or to like stop looking at that stuff. We have a literal duty as Palestinians to witness what is happening because the rest of the world is ignoring it. And some of us are better at it than others. Like I'm terrible. I'm actually terrible staying caught up on the news because I can't compare it. But thank God there are people in our community who do it constantly despite the amount of pain that it causes. Thank God for those people. Thank God for the people unwilling to look away. Because those are the people that are sharing the information with the rest of the world. Like the flooding that was happening in Gaza, I had no idea about until someone who was constantly in the news was making like told me about or posted about it. That's exactly why we need people out there constantly watching and looking and witnessing what is going on. Because otherwise the rest of the world literally would not know about it. So like don't ever tell someone who's like depressed because they're witnessing what is happening. Don't ever tell them to look away. Don't ever tell anyone to look away from the trauma and the horror that is genocide. That's how you let it happen.",

    "text": "This post encapsulates exactly what I mean. In the change in American nationalism we're seeing from Ben Shapiro to Nick Fuentes, it goes bad bunny's American. Maybe that's the problem. And then it highlights a bunch of black and brown people who they don't think are American because of their ideas, and subtextually their race. What this exemplifies is kind of a merger of the two types of white supremacy we're seeing, white supremacy that wants like America for white people, and white supremacy that centers the idea of whiteness, at least visually, around a historic traditional ideal, right? This is where we get the merging of homophobia and white supremacy, anti-feminism and white supremacy, traditional values and white supremacy. And here they're merging it. They're saying these brown people are coming into our country and not aligning with our ideas, and not specifying why they hate them. It is both because of their race, quite obviously. I mean, they labeled like six people in that post, who are black and brown, and also their ideas. Pushing the idea that their ideas, their ideology are fundamentally tied to their race, and that naturally justifies denying them Americanness. And this matters because there is a difference between a white supremacist that thinks a black or brown person could become American if they just agree with traditional ideas, right? It is the turning point USA that worked with Candice Owens, and like a Nick Fuentes type that literally could never work with black and brown people, because they think it is fundamentally tied to their race. There is a difference. I'm not saying one or the other is better, both are despicable and horrifying, but in order to accurately model out what the right wing is going to do, how they are going to function, what they believe, it's important to be able to recognize these different models. And currently, they're merging, and they're kind of working themselves out. And I think that is what we're seeing with the Ben Shapiro, Nick Fuentes split, where Ben Shapiro, very famously as a Jewish man, cannot believe that his ethnicity or his nationality or his religion determines his Americanness. He has to believe that he can earn dignity amongst white supremacists on the basis of him being a sellout, whereas Nick Fuentes says the natural consequence of white supremacy, which is, fuck no, you can't. And as we see this schism figure itself out, that's an interesting thing to watch.",

This may just be my experience, but I am scared shitless whenever I go from this north to the south and see a shit ton more cops on the road. Speed limits way more wild. And I know if I did get pulled over, they could do anything from criminalize me then and there to just let me go. And this is not an accident. This is a consequence of the history of cops and of traffic violations. Because cops in the south and in parts of the north originate as slave catchers. The primary purpose of roaming cops, which is not a universal idea across the world by the way and is comparatively new, was and I would argue still continues to be brutalized and terrorized minorities. So if you are a cop and suddenly you have to patrol the roads, won't you set that up in a way that fellow white people? Why would I want to criminalize them? That's not my job. But black and brown people, I want every conceivable excuse to pull them over, criminalize them and put them where they belong in prison. And that's exactly what the south, in their system of speed traps and traffic nonsense and really shitty DMVs does. It gives cops an excuse to pull you over and then do what they want with you. And this is why anti cop propagandists like myself focus on traffic stop violations. Because once you have the data, it becomes so clear. There was one study that showed in Pennsylvania, for example, that cops pulled white and black people over at similar rates. But they searched black people at three to five times as much. And by the way, this could all be prevented. We know that speed cameras work better to reduce speed. But we choose not to because the goal of cops on the road is not to stop you speeding. We know it doesn't really work that well. It is to terrorize black and brown people.",

Trump and his cronies will just say they're fake or don't mean what they mean or rely about them. And then what? Who's going to flip? What Trump supporter at this point doesn't already have his mind made up that what Trump says is true and what the Democrats over at the government releases is false. Who? Very few people. Very, very few people. And of those few people, are they going to mobilize? Are they going to start joining unions? Are they going to start protesting? No, no, they're not. So they are focusing on an issue that gets incredible headlines, makes their opponent look very bad, and it's good-ish for fundraising, but doesn't actually mobilize anyone, doesn't actually justify or orient people against the real problems, and is a extraordinarily good attention grabber when you don't want to focus on the people that died from snap benefits being cut, or you don't want to focus on the fact that they just capitulated one of the worst deals ever in American history following a government shutdown. It should not be read as an accident that Epstein files talk came back the second the government was back in session, instead of shitting eternally on Chuck Schumer and the rest of the Democrats for failing the American people yet again. And this isn't to say I don't want them released fine, get them released, all of the corruption, all the nastiness that it has taken to get any amount released is bad, but it is just to say if you are leftist, if you want real mobilizing change in America, it's getting enough attention. You know what I mean? Talk about other things. Focus on the Starbucks strike, focus on the anti-imperial angle, focus on issues that we can actually mobilize people around, not issues that just get white liberals mad, because we know Trump's a criminal. We already accept that, we know he's murdered people through ICE, through his DHS, through his policies. Why do we need to add to that list, rather than focusing on actually getting the criminal out of the fucking White House and disempowering his regime?",

And that is what is happening right now because Starbucks is the number one service industry company with worker labor violations. That's right. Number one, they are uniquely evil for service workers and the union is asking for bare minimum renegotiations of their contract. So if you have ever uttered the words working class or working class power in America, you need to help the Boycott against Starbucks, which means looking up and supporting the union, educating your social circle about this boycott, and most importantly, participating in the boycott and shaming anyone that doesn't.",

So the right wing model that Nick Fuentes is running off of here is not so much this concept of America as a hegemonic empire, right? This needs to be the world police and everything like that. But rather is one more similar to Liebrens' realm, the Nazi concept, right? The fascist concept. It's this idea that yes, we should have control, we should have economic power. But it is most important that we are a nation that has a lot of economic power, but we are a nation amongst other nations.

    "text": "For boycotting Israel and the UE for the role in genocide, why aren't we boycotting America? Well, it comes down to what a boycott is and what America is. Because a boycott works when consumer power can be retained such that it is cheaper and more economically effective for the actor that you're trying to change the policy of to change their policy. For example, if Walmart is underpaying their employees, you have to have a large enough consumer based boycotting that it is cheaper for them to start paying their employees better for the consumer to return. This works on small countries that you want to undermine the power of. America is a large consumer base of Israel and Israel is not making that much money off of the Palestinian genocide. It is making money undoubtedly and is politically significant. But there is a relationship there and if Israel's economy was sufficiently destroyed, it would be a reason for its policy to change. The issue is that when you are in America, so if I'm talking to Americans about an American boycot, your interest and your livelihood and even your economic power by which you could levy to have political change is intrinsically tied to the very thing that you're trying to deny political and economic power to, which is the American economy as a whole. So boycotting specific companies for specific changes like Spotify so that they don't keep playing ice ads. That works because that math could ever work out. But boycotting the country as a whole literally gets weaker as it goes on by definition and the math doesn't work. Now if you are out of America, there is a point at which you could boycott America as a whole and it would happen. But extraordinarily large solidarity networks and mutual aid and connections to alternatives must be made well before that's even vaguely feasible for the global working class. So yeah, in short, the math just doesn't work. American consumers can't boycott American goods because our interests are directly interrelated to them. And foreign consumers are not going to levy and effective boycot because of how interconnected the American economy is into the rest of the world's economy. So well before we engage in a large boycott which would look like a general strike, we need networks of solidarity, mutual aid and actually community defense for anything like that to be effective. I'm not saying it's right or it's wrong but boycotting is a tool not just a more-elistic act and you don't use a tool that won't work.",

Being populist as a right-winger means, hey, white, straight, able-bodied people that I like should have power. And I'm gonna unite the working class in their racism. And right-wing violence, I think you all know what that is, and left-wing violence is like, hey, maybe put over right to defend themselves against colonists. Those two things aren't the same when you actually set them out, nor are they. But if you simplify them down to the most basic fucking thing, liberals will be like, hmm, this Nazi has a point.

But it is a literal callback to the isolationist pressure group built up of Nazi sympathizers wanting to prevent America from going into World War II. One of the most prominent members being Lindenberg, who had a speech for the American First Committee, saying that the United States should defend the white race against foreign invasion. This organization, though, it had a diverse coalition, was famously anti-Semitic and pro-fascist. It was a cover for fascists using popular sentiment of isolationist and occasionally, very left-wing sentiment of isolationism, to get its fascist agenda through. So when they use America first today, don't be fucking fooled. These people are actually quite smart, at least the people organizing the messaging and history. Nick Fuentes knows that this exists. Nick Fuentes has read his shit. And he is using this term because the other smart fascists will recognize it for what it is, understand the strategy and understand the history. And people that don't know will fall for the same trick that was used back then.",

    "text": "This Zionist reaction to Zoran explains exactly how Israel relies on anti-Semitism. Because this American colonizer in Palestine said they were leaving the army today, but I'd like to thank the New New York City mayor for inspiring the next generation of New York Jews to follow in my footsteps. The army in question? Yeah, the Israeli occupation forces. So she is explicitly saying, based on this made-up accusation of Zoran Mombdani, who received 35% of the Jewish vote in New York, being anti-Semitic, based on that made-up lie, she's saying that that will push New York Jews to follow in her footsteps of colonizing Palestine, which is exactly what Israel relies on and why they spread all of these lies about literally anyone critiquing them being anti-Semitic. I think most people understand that that helps them avoid criticism, but it also helps them move a crute. Because if they can convince the next generation of the whole entire Jewish diaspora that they are unsafe around any person that disagrees with Israel, not only will they get people that are primed to move to Israel, which Israel is a settler colonial project relies on, but they are also primed to fight to their literal death, to defend Israel because they see any other alternative as equally threatening to their life. The undermining the genocidal ethno-state of Israel is necessary not only to liberate Palestinians, but also to actually undermine anti-Semitism. Because as long as a supremacist ethno-state exists, they will rely on a fact of bigotry outside of it to justify itself. And that motivates them, not only to cause actual bigotry, which they do when they, you know, gave funding to Hamas, for example, but also to consistently conflate critiques of itself with Judaism, which puts Jewish people in danger. So thank you so much, Daphne, because you showed us all exactly how Israel recruits, and exactly why we shouldn't believe a word out of your fucking mouth.",

The moderates would never support that. No, you don't support Palestine. Oh, we can't tax the wealthy. That's just too radical. Of course, I want to be. No, you don't want to. Because these policies, even outside of New York, are well known to be widely popular. And it is the establishment and the political elite that are pushing against them, not an uproar of this moderate that I'm yet to find. So the next time someone says that to you, ask them how they responded to Zoran. Did they vote for him? Kind of just because he was a Democrat. And I just will vote for every Democrat. Were they excited? Or were they more excited about Spanberger? Because if they were more excited about Spanberger than Zoran Mamdani, they are not interested in progress. They are interested in power. And it is not them compromising with the moderates. It is us compromising with them.",

And this is not damning because I know that some fucking intern at Heritage Foundation actually wrote this, but it is a good reminder that anti-communism is almost always a front for far right neo-fascists. And even if it is not in one particular instance, it is often instrumentalized by them explicitly. Lindenburg, like one of the original American furors used anti-communism as a front for fascism. So did George Lincoln Rockwell, another kind of historic American furor. Establishing an anti-communism week is not even a dog whistle of fascism, it is a fucking blowhorn.",

    "text": "Day the more that Nick Fuentes and his grippers infiltrate the American political system have to stop with Israel being such a key focus of our party. You don't fucking get it, do you? The reason the grippers are rising is because the left-wing in America has been saying shit like this. They have been conflating Israel and Jews such that when Israel commits genocide, anti-Semitism spikes. Israel and Zionism is promoting the rise of the far right-wing anti-Semitism. Because the more anti-Semitism rises, the more Israel can point to how much it needs to commit at the cleansing to protect Jewish people. Zionism is and has long been a very anti-Semitic ideology. And ignoring the harms and causes of it is not going to help anti-Semitism, but will actually allow anti-Semitism to fester. If we allow Israel to keep committing war crimes in the names of Jewish people, rather than criticizing it for what it fucking is, which is an ethno-nationalist colonial project that America is complicit in, the right-wing will gain more and more and more excuses to blame who they already fucking want to blame everything for Jewish people. So you have this completely backwards. It is not nearly a focus enough of our party, and it is the very failure of the American left to focus on Palestine that has caused an extraordinary rise in anti-Semitic right-wing activity. Sir, your year's name is devastatingly accurate. This is a shameless, lib-take, and it's a fucking dangerous one.",

This is not an accident otherwise it would have been solved a long time ago. Cops are there and always have been there to terrorize and commit violence against minorities that they didn't think should be where they were. Cops started out in two primary ways in America as private militias for corporations strike breaking and primarily as slave catchers.

One is still committed to America being an empire, keeping its imperial outpost and hegemony across the world. One is a nationalistic cult, doing what fascism does best, which is being a populist movement aiming at blaming minorities for previous failings of imperialism and capitalism. Both of these are fucking evil, but it is important we understand them so that we can combat them. Because this right wing, the one that is nationalistic and anti-Semitic, is not allies of anti-imperial leftists, we must never work with them. Because they are not interested in being anti-imperial to actually undermine the harms of the American empire and build solidarity across the nations, but they exist to break up that solidarity that would come from the end of empire. And that explains why they are more than happy to blame Israel on like the Jews, they are just like flagrantly anti-Semitic because they aren't recognizing it as a larger part of American empire and primarily Christian by the way supporters, they are using it as a wedge issue to get their little slice of the right and push against international solidarity that would come from the naturally dying side of the right wing, which is the neo-liberal neo-con right wing. That believes in just furthering and furthering and furthering harshness and contradictions of capitalism. So to sum that up, we have one side that is fascistic. They are obviously fascists, they are openly fascist, and that is a we are America, we are going to stay in America and we are a superior state because of it, and we are defined by our ethnicity, religion, and opposition to other ethnicities or religions. And then here is another side that is neo-liberalist and internationalist. We need because we are America and better than the rest of the world to control and police the rest of the world. And Israel as an outgrowth and control post for that is essential to that project. Both of these are fucking evil, neither of them are interested in good, both of them are just trying to retain their own power within an old system and what is the new system. And we must recognize that they both offer genuine threats to effective solidarity amongst the working class and must be combated never allied with.",

Because Israel has consistently bombed Gaza and has consistently denied sufficient humanitarian aid into Gaza, despite a ceasefire being in place. A ceasefire that did not effectuate an end to the illegal occupation of the West Bank did not guarantee sovereignty of Gaza or the West Bank or a return of Palestinians. The violence against Palestinians has not ended but has moved into a new stage where Israel has another excuse to deny it. And your voice, your attention and your action should not be instrumentalized to enable that excuse. Because regardless of what they say on paper, even though on paper they've given basically no concessions, Israel is not interested in peace and almost by definition cannot be interested in peace, as an ethno state is reliant on a consistent enemy to justify its brutality and violence.",

Well, well, well, it's not a very new game, right? It's the same game they played for a very long time, which is they want to have a destabilized Africa because they want to extract resources from Africa. Ooh, who did we learn this from? The whole entire West. So the UAE, if you don't know, made a lot of their money being basically a bunch of free zones. For like the world. So people could come to the UAE and trade. There are zero tax state. It's very nice to live in the UAE. It's very expensive, but you can get like really nice places. And they have a specific free zone. So like free zones for tech where like there's basically no regulation. You can do whatever you want. The labor is like unregulated. So it's pretty cheap. They have a free zone for gold as well, where people bring in gold to the UAE. And the primary function here, I mean, it functions for a lot of things, literally billions of dollars worth of gold to go through the UAE each year. But why it does is because with gold, specifically gold is valuable as it itself, right? And so as long as you don't mark where the gold is coming from, you know, you have money that isn't traceable. And so what happens is people bring dirty gold, gold from, I don't know, let's say Sudan into the UAE and gold that was maybe mined by people working with the RSF on stolen territory. I don't know, crazy example. And then the UAE brings that in and then they melt down that gold, make it into new bars. And they just say, I don't know where this came from. This came from the UAE. It was melted and brought by the UAE crazy. Now it's clean gold because it all goes through a mixer and so they're money laundering. So the UAE is literally a money laundering operation for African gold. And it helps people that work with the UAE, we're going to know like America get out of their human rights obligations. Because if you for example have blood minerals from Sudan in your products and they're very cheap, right? You get cheaper gold this way. You don't want people to know that. And so if you can say it came from the UAE and the UAE just doesn't have very good regulations on it, but like we know we can work with the UAE, then you can get cheaper gold from Sudan without having the human rights obligations or consequences from it. It's a way to office skate and it makes the UAE a shit ton of money every single year. So yeah, Sudan, they're escalating racial tension so that the RSF who is generally willing to work with the UAE as opposed to the Sudanese government that might want to limit that is gaining more control and is committing genocide against the non-era population.

Botswana has had a comparatively stable state in Africa for a very long time. In part, because colonists didn't effectively destabilize Botswana, in part because they didn't have a reason to, right? Because there weren't as many discovered natural resources during colonialism, whereas they found diamonds later, and then Botswana, who didn't get fucked with, already had a somewhat democratic regime.

They let a humanitarian crisis happen to their own people. How, how incompetent. And then they do neoliberal reforms. And you know, there's neoliberal forms allow the exact same thing that destabilization allows. A completely feckless government in defending their people from extraction of multinational corporations.",

You know who the lazyest motherfuckers are? Rich people! Because the vast majority of people on welfare or the vast majority of people that would benefit from socialism, the politics of the working class, are actually working for their money. But if you are born into wealth, born into privilege, you don't work for your money. So if the logic you suggest in this video, which is, well, if people are giving shit for free, they'll just stop working, applies, then the motherfuckers you are licking the boot of are the laziest motherfuckers in the world. They are! They don't work! These motherfuckers are on vacation half the time! Why are we not mad about them being lazy? Because you don't actually believe this. Because you think in your mind, in your heart of hearts, that you will be one of them and not one of us. But my God, trust me, you will be one of us. And you know how I know? Because number one, you're not already a billionaire. And number two, even if it was a meritocracy, you've fallen for the most brain-dead, fucking pro-capitalistic propaganda in the world. You don't have what it takes to be one of the one in a trillion that will end up as a billionaire. Even though once again, this isn't a meritocracy. Are social, and you know what would make it a meritocracy? Socialism! Places that implement effective welfare, or actually nationalized industries, have a higher social mobility score. If you cared about it being a meritocracy, you wouldn't support capitalism.",

And the reason you should be much, much more interested in that, the system and the people surrounding them, than their incompetence is because incompetence is next to useless politically. Sure, Trump's stupid. What does that tell me about his next move? What does that tell me about how to resist him? Nothing. But if I focus on the ways that he is highly competent, the way that him and his administration are building concentration camps around America, or engaged in building an incredibly effective surveillance state tied to a very violent enforcement mechanism, I actually have a functional view of how I can resist that. And even focusing on things that I think are stupid and wrong, like how Peter Tiel thinks there's an anti-Christ, is not incompetence, but it's just bad shit craziness. That's predictable. I can model that in how do I resist. And I'm sometimes concerned that all the focus on him being incompetent or silly or stupid is missing the point. He can be as silly and stupid as he wants. His administration is very effective and laser focused on their goals.",

Not only have whitewashing products like Dubai Chalk lived in the boo-boos, but also have a free zone for gold trade where the most amount of gold in the world is traded. And you know what Sudan's number one natural resource is? Gold. Dubai has made its wealth off of trading gold and using it not only as clearly money-laundering, but also as the backbone of the economy. And thus, it is incredibly important that it continues controlling the exchange and source of gold. And Sudan happens to be a highly unstable area that it can leverage to extract millions and billions of dollars worth of gold as long as they don't stabilize. And that is one of the largest reasons it is funding the RSF, the rapid support forces that are not only committed to and engaged in transferring gold to the UAE and through the UAE, but are engaged in active genocide of the non-Arab population of Sudan. So it is important that this is framed not as a civil conflict, but as actively involved in neocolonialism for the United Arab Emirates, which has a close connection to Israel and to America and to the global economy writ large, doing what Western and Imperial powers have long done, which is destabilized and colonized Africa to extract material wealth, because Africa is extraordinarily wealthy, the rest of the world not so much. And the fight they have long been in is to just be able to keep their fucking wealth.",

It is because ICE is not intending on getting rid of immigrants. That is not their function. Their function is to act as terrorists for the new fascist regime, and it is just as important to terrorize racial minorities with the right paperwork and dissidents with the right paperwork as it is to make a performance of terrorizing those with the wrong paperwork for your base. And so I do not want you to be more mad about these US citizens who happen to have the right paperwork for being terrorized than the people that happen to cross an imaginary line and then get terrorized by a literal fascist Gestapo. But what I do want you to take away is that they don't care, neither should you. And that means first of all, you don't give a fuck about immigration, and second of all, you should be just as scared shitless by this funded $109 billion occupying force of America as everyone with slightly different paperwork than you. And you should find much more solidarity and actually take collective action with those people who are the named enemies because you are the unnamed enemy.",

His whole entire base is different systems of far right-wing lunacy. From the burgeoning homeschooling movement to right-wing cults, to churches, evangelical churches, and mega-churches, as well as mega-corporations, Trump's base is diverse, has different aims, but has independent political power. The left wing is the same. There is no politician coming to save us, but our base is our choice. It can either be built up that exact same base of the Democratic Party, of corporations that want to pretend to be nice, minorities that are widely ignored by the party, and rich white people that can pay to have their voice heard by the party, or, or they can have their base in labor unions and tenants unions. And organizations that are willing to withhold their vote, support, are willing to heckle and strike, and have the power to sway corporate interests against the candidate. We can hope and beg that we get a politician to act against their corporate base's interests, or we can build alternative interests, and that should always be the goal. Not only because then we get better politicians, but because then we have a political system that works not only on election days, but every day.",

Though all the talk of, well, they'll just have another excuse to commit violence, they don't need an excuse to commit violence, they're going to do it anyway, which is deeply concerning because extraordinary violence is going to be committed by the American fascist regime against any and all people who resist or fall into one of the categories of people they don't like, or even just random people that get caught up in it. But it also means that we don't need to concern ourselves with the public image of effective resistance as long as it is effective, because they are going to use any form of pushback, any attack, even entirely legitimate, as justification verbally for their violence, well, they would likely do it anyway, which means our operation number one is to accelerate as quickly as they are. Just as fast as their violence ramps up, our defensive capabilities must ramp up. We must be able to support and defend and protect each other. Be less concerned with how they will react to that protection, than if we are reacting enough to their violence.",

I mean, his father is a Marxist professor. The guy is probably a pretty self-eviled socialist. But him as a candidate, very clearly, his position in the system is that of social democracy. If we look at his types of things, social democracy takes the form of softening the harms of capitalism, without offering revolutionary alternatives, things like New Deal Democrats, FDR, right? The same FDR that put like Japanese people in camps, was certainly a social democrat. The New Deal was certainly socially democratic, or Scandinavian countries that have strong social safety nets, but don't, but are still engaged in extraordinary imperialism. So social democracy offers internal calming of the capitalist extremes. Socialism, generally, this is just the definition I'm gonna work off in the most vague, unhelpful way possible, which is, socialism is the politics of the working class. Socialism is the politics of the global working class, specifically. And yeah, that's what it is. And if you aren't aligned with the politics or interests of the global working class, you're not a socialist. You're a best national socialist, but that's not a great term.",

Because I bet a bunch of you are thinking about people from 300 years ago. In most Americans' minds, colonialism ended before slavery did. But that's just not true. Formal colonialism didn't end until the 80s or 90s and informal or effective colonialism is still going on. Even in America, we had the Philippines in 1948. We had Panama until after that and we still have Hawaii. France still has the Solomon Islands and French Guyana and the British still have the fucking Falklands. So it's important that we understand colonization and colonialism, not only in the neo-colonialism sense where we are forming an economic system around the world to function towards empire's interests. But also, even that old timey, like very formal, I own you form of colonialism is still going on. That's what Puerto Rico is. And not only did it never end and take a new shape, but it also literally didn't end.",

California, Apple is based in your state. You should tax them. Currently passing legislation that might maybe possibly force ICE to occasionally wear a mask. What if you pass legislation that forces them to wear a mask? Or even better, bans them. That may not be in line with the Constitution, but they don't care. You could even make them all employees of the state and give them a visa that way. If we recognize that to properly instrumentalize the state against the federal fascist regime, we need to bend the rules, have an equal uncarrying attitude to constitutionality, or do process that they do. Maybe there's about 10 trillion other things that we could do. This is a great first step. I'm so proud of you liberals for realizing that this type of shit needs to be done. But first and foremost, there's 10 trillion other things we can do. And second of all, they're not going to fucking do it.

I hope people will see this as a reason not to relax but to fight harder, because social democracy will and always has been a bandaid on a gushing bullet wound of fascism. Like Morphean, it helps in the moment, but risks sedating effective action. But what we learned from this campaign, that there are millions of people excited for effective, socialistic change that don't fall for the multi-billion dollar industry of pro-capitalist propaganda. That is a reason to be excited, no matter how much I as a leftist want to be cynical. So right now is the time to continue this momentum by organizing non-electurally. If you got out today and voted for Zoron or in California, voted for Prop 50 or in Virginia, voted for Spanberger. Go find a mutual aid or direct action organization around you, go ask people you canvast with what they're doing tomorrow to help politics and the day after and the next weekend. Because we cannot and never have been able to vote our way out of fascism. And this will be met with extraordinary violence by the fascist regime. So we must take this momentum, this very exciting I will admit momentum, and turn it into effective action to create effective defense for our communities and infrastructure for direct action against fascists.",

Currently at 60% of the vote, a extraordinarily wide margin, showing that tonight was shaping up to be quite a large blue wave. And it bears repeating that these Democrats are very likely to shape up to continue to be feckless in an imperial fissious system that is built against them. But what it does demonstrate is that there are thousands of people that do not want this current regime, that do not support the current actions and are willing to at least take a minimal step to help prevent it. What we must focus on moving forward is taking those minimal steps and pushing them into effective action, building communities that can effectively defend themselves, support themselves, and actually support direct action against fascistic rule. So if you were out and voted in Virginia or New Jersey or California or New York today, go find a mutual aid organization in your area. Go see if they are a community defense or ice watch organizations in your area and see how you can support them. Can you get trained as a court watcher or do prison letters or prison support? Because there is a way to defend democracy and defend against fascism every single day, not just on election day.

Damn, these modern day fascists sure are using a lot of terms and tropes that the old fascists did. But instead of saying Jewish, they're saying Muslim. Because for a very long time, anti-Semitic tropes have been used against Muslims. The idea of a foreign diaspora that needs to return to where they came from, anti-Semitic trope pushed against Muslims. The idea they are invading and secretly poisoning the ideology of the West, anti-Semitic trope applied to Muslims. And this is not new. The Nazis literally did the same thing. They also considered lots of Muslims, lots of people that were from Arab lands to be Semitic. And it's important that we recognize that anti-Semitism is originated and centrally against Jewish people. But it doesn't mean that the tropes and the bigotries and the function of those bigotries, which is to support deeply unpopular fascist regimes, cannot be used against the same people. And that is exactly what we're seeing. The obsession with labeling Zoram Mamdani a jihadi communist, not just Muslim, but jihadi and communist, not just socialist, is almost directly out of the Judeo-Bullshivism playbook. And they are not even really messing around by labeling it cultural Marxism a term that literal Nazis used. So to those that have already accepted Wanderer fascist regime, here's another point in your book to why you are so fucking correct. And to those who have yet to accept that, please, for the love of God, learn anything at all about what or how the fascists from the past worked, and then just open your eyes.",

For those of you who are blessed to not know who this man is, he is the architect of the Iraq war, which killed three to five million Innocents of billions. He was instrumental in lying to the American public about weapons mass destruction that justified the literal murder of three to five million people for Absolutely no reason. That is because he was the Vice President under George W. Bush and reigned a huge portion of that power for that administration. And now, just like millions of the innocent civilians that he helped murder, he is in the ground. Although the only difference is he's not innocent at all.",

Practically you're not going to be an effective anti-fascist, know the proper tactics, understand it historically, without recognizing that thousands of people have already had a trial run at this exact same thing, just outside of America. We have an advantage because we can learn from people fighting the exact same enemy we are. Ice was trained by the IDF. If you want to undermine ice, you have to understand how the Palestinians fought the IDF. And anti-imperialists have understood this for a very long time. Ho Chi Minh's forces were helped trained by people in the IRA. And this is also true ideologically. One of the best inoculations to nationalism is seeing it in another place. Seeing the same moves emotionally and tactically and rhetorically, done by Chinese or Japanese or Korean nationalists, is extremely inoculating when Trump tries to do the same things with American nationalism. If you want my suggestion, reach out to people that have been fighting imperialism their whole life. That is why the most effective modern day anti-fascists in America came from movements that were fighting imperialism. And those movements are important in and of themselves, specifically the pro-Palestinian movement, but they were also extraordinarily effective at building effective anti-fascists, because it is the same violence and the same techniques and the same tactics rhetorically, ideologically and practically.",

If you want to help organize 10 unions, labor unions, whatever the fuck, if you want to donate to the legal funds or the mutual aid funds that are built up in these cities for people actually resisting fascism, be my fucking guest and please do genuinely. The liberal leftist divide is not this because leftists have always worked with liberals, they always have. But it has also almost always been liberals that have called the cops on leftists. They have either funded or established the organizations that demonized and terrorized leftists. So when we are talking about polarization or divide in this community that are anti-fascist, at least visually, liberals claim to be anti-fascist. The side that has always been stanchly anti-fascist and at the forefront of almost every anti-fascist movement, leftist, in my view is almost never going to be the problem in this side. And the side that has actually demonized and weaponized the state against the other side habitually is. So once again, I'm happy to work with Democrats. I know plenty of work that all of you could do just fucking ask me. I did vote for Kamala, you're welcome. Now please get the fuck to work and stop bitching that we recognize that someone who is a war criminal, hear me out, is a fucking war criminal.",

That begs the question how the fuck are they getting these raw materials? And they answered both is the same, Imperialism and Neocolonialism. And this is the context that is necessary when we are looking at the Sudanese and Congolese crises right now. Because both of these are places that the UAE are attempting to massively exploit for minerals that are essential. Both to their gold exchange which is the largest in the world and entirely unregulated. Read Money Laundering. And to the minerals in your phone, which is why Apple has been caught using blood minerals from Congo and from Sudan. Because these are not amorphous humanitarian crises that have come out of nowhere. But they are part of a large scale campaign by a series of countries and countries affiliated with the West to extract billions of dollars of resources from African countries. This is done not only through the official government funding of organizations like the RSF that destabilize Sudan and the Taliban. But also through corporate sponsors like Apple and Microsoft that are profiteering off of this massively.",

Ethiopia has never been colonized yet for the longest time. Yes, the fuck it is, and Africa is still being colonized. First of all, yeah, Ethiopia wasn't successfully colonized, but it was put through one of the most brutal campaigns of destruction and attack by fucking bonito Mussolini. What's your other example? Conversely, Botswana colonized before, and Botswana has been one of the top performers. If you were actually interested in this, you would know that Botswana, actually, for the area was one of the least touched by colonialism because its local government structure was maintained. And that the reason Botswana is such a high performer is largely because it found diamonds after the colonizer's left. But you don't, because this was posted by ladies for liberty. A libertarian think tank that blames everything on bad regulations for business, which is precisely what you do. Ignitions of ours are the hardest ones in the world to do business in. What's so funny about this explanation is that Botswana nationalized its primary industry of natural resources, and Ethiopia is fucked because of multinational corporations stealing its natural resources. The issue is not if you gave a fuck about once again any of these actual policies, businesses not being free enough in Africa, but if you actually were interested, it is businesses being too fucking free in Africa. According to your organization, Botswana is a communist socialist hellhole because its primary income driver is state owned, whereas Ethiopia is an economic free zone because multinational corporations are able to extract billions of dollars of wealth in minerals and resources from it. But you don't, because you're repeating turning point USA talking points to prove a point that you think serves libertarianism, but if you look at all into it, clearly justifies decolonization and socialization of national industry.",

Because as always, their goal is to demobilize effective action, and they're doing this by highlighting it as a humanitarian crisis that exists in a bubble. Not a natural outgrowth of Western and Emirati imperialism, to steal mass amounts of resources from multinational corporations. And I've already explained why that narrative is true and this narrative is false, so I want to highlight the consequences of both of these. If you think it is a humanitarian crisis, the answer is charity. And from a Western mind that actually justifies more Neor imperialism, more non-profits connected to corporations go in, center themselves, and get good photo ops feeding children, warm maintaining racist narratives that undermine African self-determination. Whereas if you think it is an outgrowth of Neor imperialism and enabling corporations to steal millions and billions of dollars of natural resources, the solution is to decolonize, get the Western influence out of here, and to mobilize effective action against people like the United Arab Emirates. Or Apple, who has been caught using Sudanese blood minerals. One pushes you to white-savirism and Neor imperialism. One pushes you away from imperialism and towards effective boycotts, direct actions, and radical effect. So every time you notice it, as it does become worse and worse and worse because what we are seeing is despicable, such that the mainstream media can no longer actively ignore it, they are going from ignoring to pushing the energy to where they want it.",

    "text": "So today is the 108 year anniversary of something called the Balfour Declaration, and I literally just wrote about this in my book So I figured it'd be a really good time to tell you all about it Now this declaration was basically just a letter from the British Foreign Secretary and his name was Arthur Balfour And it was signed on November 2nd, 1917 But what this letter did was it made the Zionist project go from like a fringe radical idea that was Only popular amongst a minority of the Jewish population at the time to a fully state-backed Colonialist project backed by the British military Which of course tracks, but why would the British backing this project have such an impact on the colonization of Palestine? The answer is again Colonialist conquest by the British you see in 1917 when World War I ended the British took over a lot of the land that the Ottoman Empire had including the land of Palestine for a little while It was actually called British Mandate Palestine So all the people that said Palestine ever existed the British literally named it British Mandate Palestine And so to them the British owned the land and in 1917 Arthur Balfour had heard of this project called the Zionism where they're basically trying to figure out where should the Jewish state be? And they decided that it would be Palestine. So all their Balfour said yes We agree we support this idea of a Jewish state in Palestine And so that is what sent the British army to work with Zionist militias in Palestine to start eradicating people from their homes And that's our way before 1948 when Israel was created But basically the Balfour Declaration is what gave the Zionist project the military backing and the like political support that it needed to Eventually become the thing that would then become Israel and don't worry This book is not just like a history book But I felt as in Palestinian it was my duty to try and explain these things to people that never heard of them And so this is just peppered in with the rest of the Wild stories of my life But I'm gonna go back to writing. I hope that was a little bit educational for you And now you understand more than ever that the British fucking sock",

Because they will lie, defame, slander, attack, and when they can't do that, they will kill leftists who are effective. And so while internal critique is great and necessary and helpful, if the first thing on your mind for why the left is losing, is anything the left is doing and not anything the people actually in power are doing to suppress the left, your model is categorically wrong. And the next time you feel cold to say something like, the left would be successful if we just did this, think if we just did it would still allow the government to kill us. And if the answer is yes, that's the bigger issue. Because I agree, leftists are really fucking annoying, but also everyone is. That's not why we're losing. We're losing because we threaten power.",

But to undermine this talking point, just to be clear, this is a far right-wing evangelical conspiracy that actually threatens the stability and peace of Christians and Muslims in Nigeria. Because for the exact same people that have been hand-ranging about the use of the word genocide, for these past two years to avoid recognizing the Palestinian genocide, they are very free and willing to recognize any form of attacks on Christians as genocide, despite ethnic conflicts in Nigeria being exponentially more complex than that, actively defended from by the government, because the number one named enemy of the Nigerian government is Boko Haram, the perpetrators of these attacks. And not to mention that there are Christian terrorist groups that are killing Muslims in Nigeria and neighboring regions. And none of this would be helped with American military intervention, or cutting off aid. The government of course wants to get rid of Boko Haram. An America cutting off aid does not help that. America militarily striking them does not help that, but don't be confused, they don't believe this shit either.",

The UAE that the BBC has a center in because if we recognize that they're funding it, suddenly we have to do something about it. Suddenly we aren't just the white saviors that can go into Africa and stop. The savages from killing each other, but we are actually the perpetrators of this violence because the RSF, actually fucking name it, the militia that is committing this genocide, are doing so with American, and English, and French, and German, and Emirati weapons, and a shit ton of financing from the Emirates. So while I am pleased you're recognizing it as a genocide, recognizing it as a catastrophe, you are only making the problem worse if it looks like an amorphous humanitarian concern and not a direct consequence of neocolonialism.",

Because in activist circles, especially where we're trying to understand a very large, complex system, we should be yes-ending and not no-butting. For example, Israel is evil and genocide in the Palestinians and using American weapons. And the UAE has a close tie to Israel in America and is committing genocide in Sudan. And are using that as a stronghold to commit genocide in Congo. And are using Rwanda as a center. There is a way to talk about issues in a way that doesn't make them compete against each other, but focuses our energy on how to undermine them as a whole system. This becomes clear when you talk about people that don't want to undermine that system. The way Zionists use Congo in Sudan and all the other atrocities like in Myanmar and in Bangladesh are by pitting them against each other and attempting to make us dislike each other for not covering every single thing. And I want this disclaimer to be in the center. I understand why people are drawn to make this point. Because yes, there is racism in why people focus on Palestine and not Sudan or Congo and racism and why people aren't talking about Myanmar or Bangladesh. This is true, it's not my place to critique people that are coming from that position. But I want to offer as an alternative to everyone, especially those that are not coming from the oppressed or attacked backgrounds, that one of the best ways to actually compellingly communicate on these issues is to connect it to issues that you already care about and bring it into a larger meta-structure. Because they are all of these are outgrowth of imperialism generally and capitalism universally. And if we can highlight their commonalities as well as the interesting ways that they are different, that will be much more effective and actually honest and capable of mobilizing more people on a wider coalition, which is ultimately what we want. We don't want just a movement for Sudan or Congo or Palestine, even though it is great to have those things. We want a movement to effectively undermine the imperial arms and systems that are arming those conflicts. Because if we don't have a fluid effective coalition, the imperialists will just move to another place. And then they will play the game and instrumentalize some of y'all to play the game along with them and go, why aren't you bothered about our new conflict? It's a nasty game. It's made to pit us against each other. And there are reasons that it works and doesn't that I don't want to undermine an idea. I'm not attempting to insult anyone that has engaged in that. I understand it. But please, at least when you are called to make that sort of point, consider talking about it as, yes, Palestine is very important. And have you noticed how the American empire is outro here? And have you noticed how wide this empire is here? Because we should be paying attention to them. But we should also be building a system and coalition to effectively undermine all of them together.",

The new data centers being created to power AI are extraordinarily intensive on the environment, and are physically poisoning the water and communities that they are around. Second of all, it is clearly an economic bubble that we are being gaslit around. I wrote a sub-stack on this issue, but basically the companies are lying to you, they are lying to their investors, and it's pretty obvious that they are. And a huge portion of the American economy is being made up by this fucking scam. Regardless of the underlying value proposition, it is overblown, and it will fuck up the working class. Because that's what bubbles do, especially when they are accounting for like 92% of America's GDP growth in the last quarter. And then third, there's a plagiarism problem. They are stealing the work of especially small artists. Now I'm a communist. I don't believe it in an actual property, and I think we should have a different economic model for how art and etc. is shared. But that economic model is certainly not mega-corporations being able to profiteer while they use intellectual property laws to diminish and attack any other innovative sectors. So these are the three primary main like compelling arguments against AI period, and like why you would have semi-anomacity towards the technology and its industry. And so even if you think it is inevitable, I probably do. I think some form of LLM is going to be helpful, going to be useful eventually. You can recognize how these three issues are still reasons to say, hey, we should slow the fuck down on this because it is hurting people and harming lives. So this is a primer. I hope that makes it clear why leftists have issues with this. We're not just Luddites. We are genuinely worried about the environment, the economy, and the artists.",

    "text": "This is for everyone who thinks socialists are always working class. Which should be no one. Lenin, the leader of the first effective socialist revolution, was not raised working class. That said, Zoron was. His father being a professor is working class. His mother working to make her money as a film producer is working class. Just because they were wealthy doesn't mean they weren't working class. You don't know what that word means. Even though you were right that historically socialist leaders tend to be the people that are better off in the working class. That is because the politics of the working class can be expressed articulated and analyzed by people not raised or experienced in that class. And actually very often the people with the resources and time and energy to do the academics and analysis of understanding the working class politics as a cohesive politic are not. Because the function of being working class is depriving you of that opportunity to develop analytically. Anyone levying this critique doesn't understand leftist or working class politics and is engaged in identity and politics. Much as the same person decries identity politics.",

    "text": "Sudan is not a civil war, it is a invasion by the UAE. The UAE that has strong ties to America and Israel and is funding the rapid support forces the RSF who have been found with American, English, French, and Emirati weapons. This is important to center because Americans have been racistly conditioned to believe that African countries are just inherently unstable. And thus immediately primed to dismiss any conflict in Africa as natural or expected, either from a left or right context. And part of deconstructing that is constructing a different conception of what's happening. And right here is very clear. This is a form of neocolonialism. The UAE is interested in stealing Sudan and Congo's gold and materials. And then in collaboration with their Western Imperial forces are invading the UAE and destabilizing the Congolese and Sudanese governments to ensure access to those minerals. So do not be confused and do not fall into the racist tropes that we were taught. This is not Africans being unable to govern themselves or yet another humanitarian disaster in Africa. This is an active, profiteering Imperial force. And one that America and England and France are also responsible for. So if we want to undermine in the Imperial violence that is returning to America in the force of fascism, we have to understand the Imperial violence that is still being inflicted upon the rest of the world by the American and Western empires.",

And speaking of hunger for resources, in Venezuela, the United States tried to kidnap President Maduro by bribing his pilot to bring him to the United States. Huh, I wonder why. Maybe it's because they have four times the oil reserves of Saudi Arabia. And it isn't real. During the so-called ceasefire, last night, they unalived 100 people, 46 of which are children, yet they're saying they're still adhering to the ceasefire. And in the Caribbean, Hurricane Melissa has hit Jamaica hard. So if you like Jamaican food, Jamaican culture, Jamaican music, don't just offer prayers, but actually donate. And speaking of the Caribbean, it seems as though everyone is still cool with Cuba except the United States and these six countries. Oh, and here in America, it's the 30-a-day of the government shutdown. The Gestapo is still running the streets. And California is going to have police patrol grocery stores the same day your snap benefits get cut off. If now isn't the time to revo- Can't say that. We're on Instagram.

And this is obvious when you look at how ICE is structured. It is not a state law enforcement to enforce the law. It is a federal militia effectively and directly under the control of the federal government to enforce kind of regulations of the border. And it is obvious that they are oppositional to the law because they are picking people up outside of courtrooms. If you are following the law, the court is your ally, not your enemy. And so they literally kidnap people outside of courtrooms because they are not willing to go inside of courtrooms. ICE is structured and acts like a private militia and given that most of them are not identifying themselves, I am willing to bet that ICE is randomly deputizing the white supremacist militias that it is based on.",

But why aren't people being arrested for it? And more so, why do you not think about it as a criminal offense? There's so much to interrogate and undermine that beyond the simple observation that the police live to serve the ruling class. But also, to a large extent, Americans have internalized this concept of criminality. Criminality is that which harms the ruling class in many complex ways. So much so that it is an absurd idea to throw corporations that engage in theft in jail. Yet we have the most punitive and servitutal and carceral state for working class people that dare engage in even vaguely similar actions for their own welfare or livelihood. So if you are ever called to justify any punitive measure against anyone for almost anything, attempt to consider why that has not been called for against the ruling class. You can maybe justify some punitive measures in some context for something. But until we haven't even vaguely equitable system, I have next to no interest in doing so.",

Because we must very quickly move from being surprised and aghast at the incredible violence that the American working class has been and is engaged in to focusing on why they are engaging in it. Because that is their last option. And the things they focus to engage in violence against is very indicative of what actually works against them. And class solidarity and liberation of black and brown and other minorities in America is by far the thing that scares them the most. And so if you, like me, are scared shitless of the increase in cop and ice and federal violence that we are seeing, this should be a guide. Get together with workers, engage in militant resistance and build the networks that freed slaves had to to effectively just exist while your existence as resisting the working class becomes more and more illegal.",

Congo, Sudan, and Palestine are not separate issues, but especially in the context of American imperialism, different symptoms of the same violence. So don't let this be all what about, but a yes and. So while I will caveat this by saying there is a long, ongoing conflict in Congo that is incredibly difficult to summarize in one minute, the recent uptick and focus of the boycott movement is the M23 Rebels, which are backed and funded by Rwanda. A militia group that has been credibly accused of targeting killings on the base of ethnicity, which is genocide and an incredible amount of war crimes being funded by. Rwanda, which has incredibly close ties to the UK and France, as well as America, given all three of those cell arms to them. And you might recognize that from the Rwanda scheme that the UK was proposing with foreign migrants. And you might be asking, why would they want to do this? Well, you have to remember who Western governments serve. And that is, of course, multinational corporations profiting off of their war crimes. And Apple and Microsoft have incredibly accused of using conflict minerals, i.e. minerals that just so happen to come from Congo, which is incredibly rich in minerals. So let's put it all together, folks. There is a genocide being committed by a Rwandan-backed militia in Congo. Rwanda, which itself is in turn backed by Western governments. Who are constituted of and pushed by Western corporations that stand to profit from conflict in Congo? If you know anything about imperial history, this should not be a new story to you. They've just added more steps to it, which does, in fairness, make it more complex. But it does not make it any more despicable or brutal. And it also doesn't make it any less fightable. Because the first step is recognizing that this is a symptom and outgrowth of disgusting Western imperialism. And the next step is mobilizing the weapons that we do have to undermine and take the winds out of Western imperialism to this. The first of which is advocacy and then action. Advocacy being this, tell people that this is something the America and the West is compliciting. And push all forms of actual effective rule of law, right? Like push for the ICJ to call this what it is. And then action, I don't have faith that the American government is a good point of action for this, but corporations have a thin line. And if they are called out and held to account for it, that can be effective. And boycotts against Apple are hard, but they are possible. So if you're interested in the dynamic list of actions and advocacy that can be done, you can follow Team Congo on Instagram and here. Because the goal is not to care or educate for caring or educating sense. And it is also not to divert from other harmful battlefields of American imperialism like Palestine. But to understand that these are interconnected. And as we fight one, we fight the other. And that we cannot fight one without fighting the other.",

    "text": "Activism is a muscle and not a zero-sum game. You might have heard that before and you might have not, but it's incredibly important to remember. Because the best bulwark we have against the imperial violence that is returning home in the form of fascism is the very forces that fought imperialism abroad. Be that the domestic movements like the anti-arach war movement, the pro-Palestinian movement, the anti-vietnam war movement, or the strategies that were developed in the periphery of actually effective resistance, building of defensive networks and mutual aid organizations, and connections internationally to fund and organize. We are not starting from nothing. Hundreds of thousands of people have fought American imperialism before, and all fascism is, is that violence returned home. So we must build on the work that people have done within America to go against that violence as it has existed previously and learn from those that fought at abroad. And in order to do this, we must remove our biases and harmful ideologies that undermine, animalize, or dismiss the importance and complexity and maturity of effective resistance in what was historically known as the Third World. And we must ensure that the movements that were built up in the pro-Palestinian movement, the anti-arach war movement, etc. are not of saveurism, but of genuine mutual interest in understanding. Because the exact strategies that are being used to fight Israel, in Gaza, Israel, in Yemen, the RSF in Sudan, must be learned and adapted as the exact same oppressors come home.",

    "text": "You've heard about Sudan but don't know why you should care and don't know enough about it. I promise if you are interested in undermining American imperialism, you need to be paying attention to what's happening in Congo and Sudan. So let's start by recognizing the enemy, which is the United Arab Emirates. You know the UAE where Abu Dhabi and Dubai are? Yeah, they're funding an insurgent group in Sudan to engage in genocide, known as the RSF, and they were actually in the ICJ being accused by the same people accusing Israel of genocide, South Africa, recently, and they got out of it because of a technical reservation in the genocide convention, not because the court found them not guilty. And this is following credible accusations of them actively funding the RSF, which is that they have all but admitted and accurate and habitual reports of the RSF committing massive war crimes. And you might be asking Will, I'm an American, I see how we are connected to the genocide in Israel, how we connected this. Thus a starting place, the UAE was part of the Abraham Accords, to as an agreement America facilitated, maintained to strong arm these countries into recognizing and supporting Israel. There are also the fourth largest receiver of American weapons in the Middle East. America has long maintained and profited from the existence of the UAE, which was built on slave labor. And the UAE's foreign power is an expansion and extension of Western imperialism largely. I want to be clear, this is not the exact same, the level of connection the UAE and Israel have to America are different, the conflicts are different, and there is relevant analysis to be done as to how they are different. But if we as leftists are genuinely interested in undermining Western imperialism, bringing an end to the brutality of the American Empire, we must understand the expansiveness of it. And it is very clear that the massive increase in violence that the UAE is funding and inciting in Sudan must be a focus for what we must undermine. And so how you can start doing it is educating people on the connection between American imperialism and Sudan and boycotting the UAE. This can be done first and foremost by not fucking visiting, but also if you go to boycottue.org, you can find targets of companies to target boycott. There's been a lot of discourse around this for a long time, but right now is the best time to start if you haven't already.",

    "text": "Just because people had to join the military doesn't mean they didn't cause harm or commit war crimes during their time in the military. And this was my point. In America, I have friends that went into the military. I have a lot of family that went into the military. I understand the pull and push factors of joining the military. But from an outside American perspective that does not have that personal buy-in, it is self-evident these people are committing war crimes and oftentimes doing so unapologetically. So while it is true that us as leftists should keep a material and economic view of this particular instance, it is important that we actually do that consistently. So if you maintain grace personally for veterans and people in the military because you know why they had to join, you have to keep that same grace for IDF soldiers because it is legally required for them and yet many of them do so unapologetically just as many military members do. Also, I recognize and agree that veterans are in a different sense massive victims of the American Empire. They are wildly underserved, wildly dismissed and oftentimes extremely injured by the war crimes that they were made to commit. But none of that undermines the fact that they are still accountable for the actions that they took and they should be accountable in the same way that leftist advocate accountability which is non-carceral restorative, truth and reconciliation justice. And when we are talking about Israel, it seems a lot of leftists lose their fucking head saying very carceral shit against Israelis and against Israeli like military members that they would never say against their own uncle in the army or the military or the Navy. And if you wouldn't say that about your uncle in the military, I don't really want to hear it. So not only is it inconsistent because you don't hold this for all war criminals of the American Empire, but I would also posit that it is also unproductive. First of all, it should be the Palestinians to hold their Israeli oppressors to account. They should be the one that implement the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, however that ends up looking for them. But second of all, it's unhelpful us as advocates for this struggle want to delude, just want to undermine the Israeli delusion that they will all get slaughtered if Palestine comes into existence. And if we say shit that threatens the very existence of Israeli human beings in that place or Israeli human beings generally and offers no way out. It makes them on death ground and it makes them more likely to fight to the death to maintain the colony. We don't want that. Whereas if we offer a way out, not out of accountability, but with their life, with their livelihood, they'll understand when the stakes change and they are changing. So please stop doing carceral nonsense, hold your fucking veteran uncle to account, and let's free Palestine.",

    "text": "Do you have a model for what accountability looks like or are you using it as a replacement for being a cop? Because I think there's a pretty even split online of people that are genuinely interested in like restorative justice and community accountability and people that are just fucking cops and using accountability as a term to be cops. And I think it's important that we just do actually explicate that distinction because accountability is important because we want communities to stay together and communities to be effective and non-harmful and abusive. And in order for that to work we have to have someone did something wrong, right? They hurt people, they have now made a man's and they have reached a point of forgiveness or tolerance of that community they have hurt or those people they have hurt. But if what accountability looks like to you, if the end of that is them being expelled from public life, you're not looking for accountability, you're looking for punishment, it's a very different thing. And I know everyone's going to be like, oh what prompted this will? Literally nothing. I'm not thinking of any examples. I just have like experienced this throughout like 10 trillion different contexts online and it's important that we actually understand this. Because I am infinitely interested in building effective coalitions, I'm infinitely disinterested in what someone did wrong 20 years ago. Unless the victims of that come forward and say, I want you to be interested in this fantastic let's go see it. You know what I mean? Cool. And this is really easy for me because I'm not of the groups that would typically be harmed or offended. But when I am right when someone does shit against gay people or queer people or whatever, this is the model I attempt to place. Which is there has to be something they can do right now to demonstrate to me that they are a different person or they have bettered themselves or they do feel harm or they they've been they've atone to the victims that they are actually caused. And if there is no path forward with that or they aren't willing to do so, right? That's a failure on one of our parts to engage in an actually rehabilitative structure. And I work as hard as possible to make sure it's not a failure on mine.",

    "text": "Thus, read theory leftists need a rebrand and stick with me. This is coming from a good place because I want people to understand radical theory as much as possible. But the phrase, just read theory, is not compelling, right? Because most Americans don't read. Myself included, by the way, I don't have a bit truly read. Even though I do have like a degree, I studied law and I read theory. And not only is this a problem that we won't solve in time for people fighting fascists, but we also don't have to. Because while media literacy is low, media consumption is incredibly high. And people engage with incredibly complex discussions and ideas every day when they are scrolling, listening to podcasts, watching articles, whatever the fuck. And if we very simply shift from just read theory to here's some content I really enjoyed you should watch it, which people I think intend to do. But there are certain circles within leftist discussions where the theory nerds are addicted to reading, which is fine for you. But if you're trying to bring people in, that's not how you do it. And there are a bunch of critiques here. I think a lot of that is coming from built-in elitism and und deconstructed elitism, where we idealize reading and the academia ivory tower. And we idealize historical figures, which we probably should. But there is no reason we have to engage with them through what they wrote, rather than, for example, a long video reading out what they wrote or interpreting what they wrote. Or a podcast going through it, because for example, so that's my basic, sorry, that's my basic critique. Just point them to content, which I think a lot of you intend to do. But when you open with just read theory or let's read theory, and then you secondarily go with accessibility, people inherently feel otherwise and feel separated from what you're doing and demeaned in a way that shouldn't be done in leftist circles, especially when people are genuinely trying to understand it. So that's the basic ask. And if you're going to try and elitism me, I mean, I have a degree from one of the university studying law reading theory. I'm not doing this because I can't or because I'm lazy. I'm like just one of the many, many Americans that doesn't really enjoy sitting down reading a book. And so telling me to be a good leftist, I have to sit down and read a book, as opposed to watch a video essay or listen to a podcast or listen to an audio book, is not going to work and you will never win that. Second of all, if you want to think about this and learn how to better propagate propaganda, how do the Christians do it? Do they just say go read the Bible? Yeah, many of them do, but they also have podcasts and Bible studies where they separate the Bible into really small little bits. And they also have a shit ton of wandering preachers that will go and say it, where are the leftist preachers? That's kind of what I'm doing here, right? But if I was a just read theory guide, my call to action would be not pray, but go read. And I don't love that. So yeah, just read theory nerds, just change your demand. Just go from just read theory to listen to theory, watch theory, engage with it. And you will be so much more tolerable.",

    "text": "Pops the only reason you're not committing crime. If there were no cops, would you commit crime? Would you commit the really serious crimes that everyone says cops are there for? Or would you maybe steal food that you need to eat? Because if we all recognize that we probably wouldn't be committing those really violent crimes, and I've never met a person who would if there wasn't just a cop there, maybe cops are materially incentivized on continuing making us believe that there is sub-random, sub-class of people that do need violence committed against them to prevent them from committing those crimes. Maybe the perception of that group is much more important to them than actually stopping that group. And maybe they're gonna use every bias they can in their playbook to convince you that whatever group you think would be committing those crimes certainly are. And once you start thinking about cops like that whose main interest is not actually solving crime but making sure you know about crime and able to envision a criminal in a way that makes you want to continue supporting them, they make a lot more sense. They don't look, it's not disappointing when they fail to stop crime, it's not their job. It's not surprising when they brutalize minorities, that's entirely in line with their goals. And it is not offensive when we call for the abolition of them. That is precisely what you should do when you actually realize what their function is.",

Because cronyism is literally how capitalism functions. It is the power of capitalism when it magically affects politics which literally every social power ever will. And capitalists inherently understand this, right? Whenever we talk about socialism, they're like, God, but what if the people get power in the government through socialism? But if they actually believe that economics could be separated from politics, this wouldn't be a concern to them. But they don't, right? Or they dilude themselves into believing that massive wealth inequality won't lead to massive political inequality, but it obviously does. And so crony capitalism is exactly the same as liberal Zionism. It's a nonsensical addition that doesn't actually undermine the evil and harm of the core ideology and is made so that you can attack something else, right? Like the far right, the alt right, or only Netanyahu, right? When actually you should be attacking the fundamental central ideology that is causing and creating these quote-unquote externalities.",

Its aim is to give supplemental money for their grocery budget so that low-income families can afford nutritional food essential to health and wellbeing. This program is not meant to provide your grocery budget. This program is not meant to be able to live off of or be able to eat. It is to be that small difference between buying really, really cheap, unhealthy, unnutricious food and being able to buy just slightly more better nutritional food that makes the difference in your and your children's lives. And the necessary correlate of this is that when you do not provide this to people, you are literally stunting their and their children's growth and nutritional ability to live. People will starve. And I fear that the vast majority of people tolerating that, supporting it, or just thinking that they should not give this program any more way. Don't understand the program they're dealing with.

Historically, this is how it goes. Mussolini was funded by industrialists who feared labor unions more than dictatorship. And in Germany, the Reich was funded by Christen so that he could get protection and contracts. And in late-stage Roman Empire, private elites funded legions when the Treasury ran dry. Crazy thing about that $130 million, it only covers 2% of what's needed. That pay period is normally $6.6 billion. So 26,000 soldiers will be getting their payment. But you know who won't be getting their food stamps? When the war machine starts passing the hat around a billionaires, you know that you're not in a democracy, but the collapse of an empire, a private-donator, bankrolling a public army. In America, to have a coup, you don't need to seize control of the army. You can just pay for it. Elon Musk's shaping wars with Starlink, Peter Teal destroying the administrative state, and Timothy Mellon directly paying soldiers.

The promise of streaming was that you would get all your media for like $10 a month and now you don't. It was a lie. And the reason they were forced to make that promise was because if they didn't, the natural consequence of having the internet where you can freely share any information is that piracy becomes a lot easier and pretty much unstoppable. So I can't legally advocate piracy. But I can advocate that you boycotts Spotify because their grip on the industry is not strong. And actually, I'm surprised that they have such dominance. And if you use Spotify like I do mainly for podcasts, I promise you podcasts can be found literally anywhere else. Actually, this is a great opportunity to download an RSS player and move your podcast listening to that to not support any corporation.",

And we all knew that would happen, but it is an important time to remind you that Andrew Cuomo, the Zionist candidate in this race, who has maybe his number two complaint against Zoran is that he's anti-Semitic because he doesn't believe in a Jewish ethno-state in the land of Palestine. That type of Zionism relies on Islamophobia. It's not just that he only cares about anti-Semitism in a problematic way that ignores Islamophobia. It is that the way he cares about anti-Semitism, which is only in so far as it supports a ethno-nationalist supremacist ideology and not actual lived experience of Jewish people in New York and in the world, that type Zionism relies on Islamophobia. Because you cannot justify brutalizing attacking and undermining the human rights of Palestinians who are overwhelmingly characterized as Muslim and are, but I'm talking about the character here. You don't engage in some form of bigotry for them to undermine their humanity, but not only does it allow you to attack them, but also the bigotry gives you a justification for attacking them because they're characterized as brutalistic or animalistic. So it is no accident that his form of caring about anti-Semitism, which is really just a defensive Zionism in this case, is built in with Islamophobia. This is not new. It is characteristic of the ideology and it is not fighting any bigotry. And historically, Islamophobia and anti-Semitism are actually intrinsically interlinked.",

Corporate social media to what the internet is meant to be a decentralized, actually democratic entity. And the answer was made about 20 years ago. We have democratic technologies. Just look at how podcasts are run. The RSS feed is very democratic, literally anyone can host one, and it gets distributed over pretty much every distributor. Why do my posts not work that way? Why do I have to manually reupload across three different platforms? Why do my tweets not work that way? It's because a few corporations got a massive control over the internet and actually took back our technology. So if you're a boycotting spotifier trying to move off of meta or just trying to have leveraging power against these massive tech conglomerates, start thinking about how to move your consumption off of their platforms. How do you get in contact with your favorite creators if they get banned on Facebook? Getting podcasts is the easiest, download an RSS player, and subscribe to your favorite podcasts. Blogs work very similarly. So if you read substack or listen to podcasts, or want your news, there are very decentralized ways to do that right now. As to short form and tweets that's being developed and slow, and the best thing you can do is move over to things like Massidon or Blue Sky. But these social media platforms control over us is arbitrary. They are not providing a better service other than an algorithm that can be recreated. And as they become more authoritarian, it is important to start regaining our power. So I'm working it on my side as a creator, I'm like making some stuff, and I'd appreciate if all of y'all did.",

Prisoners can and should be fighting for every liberatory struggle, and they are some of the most politically well educated people I've ever spoken to. But once you understand that all Democrats care about is your vote. It becomes clear why they don't care about certain people. They actually don't care about immigrants. They deport them massively. You ask why? Because their base of racist white people that are just a little bit more self-aware are perfectly willing to throw immigrants under the bus, and the Democratic establishment doesn't lose anything. They're not deporting voters. And that is why when we are talking about political efficacy or the next election or harm reduction when liberal say it. We need to remember that there are other avenues than voting. You can organize locally, militantly, effectively, across labor, across tendency, across debt. You can organize as a person.

My brother in Christ, no one thinks children should be allowed to do anything on the base of merely what they say. So let's break down the actual claim. First of all, if you're talking about social transition, I don't think we should ever force gender on children ever. If a person born male wants to wear a dress as a child, I think you're the weirdo for saying no. Second of all, if you're talking about medical transition, which rarely happens, literally no one suggesting that goes through without a parent and a doctor consenting. And the doctors are bound by actual moral practices that are, hear me out, regulated and tested, unlike you who has no background in medicine. So stop making shit up because you're literally putting people's lives at risk. This is not just a disagreement and ideology. This lies that you are spreading literally get trans people targeted for violent crime. It is disgusting, it's unacceptable, you're not welcome.",

Living with your parents is the standard in many cultures even until your 30s, even when you get married. And killing that tradition of living in communal, multi-generational families is very profitable for some, and very, very harmful to society at large. And this is the same individualism that was pushed into American society primarily because it's profitable, that is causing what we call the male loneliness epidemic. So if you actually care about the male loneliness epidemic, if you actually care about what is very real about that part, which is people are lonely, you should stop using that as an insult, and you should start advocating for actually living in community. And that means deconstructing a lot more of wasp-talking points than we're willing to admit.",

This is a real headline from the Free Presses substack. Who cares if AI's a bubble? If the AI bubble bursts, investors will undoubtedly get burned, and my goal isn't to undermine this, it's stupid. But it is important because this shows what corporations are paying Barry Weiss, well-known big-id and Zionist, to say, which is, don't care about it being a bubble. Ignore AI over investment. Ignore that way too much of our GDP is pushed into kind of maybe useful possible technology that is also poisoning our water and burning our planet. Ignore that. It's useful. And if it isn't, only the investors are going to be burned. But obviously, that's not true. I mean, people are being burned right now by it, and the government will inevitably bail it out and is invested also billions of dollars into it, but they want you to ignore it. And this is a cheat across life. If you want to understand what Fox News is trying to sell your grandparents in a slightly nicer, cleaner way, or even CNN is trying to sell you, look at shitty propaganda. Look at Prager U. Look at Turning Point. Look at Free Press, because they are, we're set it.

And for those of you who don't know, this is classic economic fascism. A lot of you might not know that because fascism rightly so has mainly just become a slur. Classical fascist economics, like the ones literally advocated for by Mussolini, were the union of the state and corporations, with the state being the negotiator and arbiter between corporations. It's a lot more complicated than that, but that's the basic framework. And this is the most clear, obvious, and quite frankly blatant example. Them not only being fascistic, but quite play by play following the fascist framework. Of integrating the power players in the capitalist, market structure into the state. It's important to recognize that this has been happening for the past few decades. But doing it openly, honestly, and celebrating it is, in my analysis, very much the difference between modern neoliberalism and the current uprising wave of fascism. So if anyone ever challenges that Trump's a fascist, point them to this and point them obviously to like the rising Gestapo violence, etc. Because he is playing into the exact fascist playbook. And I think we all know what to do with fascists.",

    "text": "Shroudinger's leftist is not an accident. For those of you who haven't heard of it, Shroudinger's leftist is the correct observation that leftists are somehow seen as the most powerful group in the Democratic Party, and though reason commoner lost, and are not powerful enough to listen to, and get nothing done because they can't get organized. We're organized enough to ruin everything, but not organized enough to have power or relevant critiques. And the conversation usually ends there, just observing that they're a bad faith actor is critiquing us for both sides. That's obvious. I think we can all accept that that's a thing that's happening. What I want to talk about is why this is happening, and it is the same thing that comes down to a lot of bad faith critiques coming from the establishment, which is that they are bad faith. They're being funded, and they have a material interest in undermining or attacking leftists. Because leftists are inherently anti-establishmentarian, right? If you are anyone working in establishment politics, if you are anyone working for elected office, if you are anyone who has taken funding from billionaires or millionaires, you will have invested interest in undermining, diminishing, or attacking leftists on all fronts. It doesn't have to be realistic. And that's not saying that if you do many of those things, you can't do good things or have a positive effect, right? This is not individual. It's just saying every single person like that has a vested interest that they either have to actively work against or will fall into in undermining and attacking leftists. And this is why, by the way, leftists are so fucking cynical of every single organization or person or group that do these things. Because we know that they have invested interest in undermining attacking us in bad faith manners. And that doesn't mean that these people can't do good, that doesn't mean that we can't build effective coalition with them. It just means that that must always be done critically and cynically. So if you spot Schrodinger's leftist in the wild, understand what's going on. There is valid critiques of lots of leftists. Don't get me wrong. But there's also a lot of really bad faith critiques of them.",

    "text": "The AI bubble is not just AI overvalued. It is the economics of a failing American Empire. If you'll stick with me, I'll go through some of the context that makes me very certain of this. Because from the raw materials that this bubble is being based on, to the ending financial schemes, it's fucking turtles all the way down. Starting with this graph, which explains why the AI bubble is so fucking massive. Not only because classic investors are wildly too excited about this technology, but also because Nvidia, which is worth 4.5 trillion, is basically producing its own demand by investing in other smaller companies with the condition that they buy back from Nvidia. So this leads to a massive overvaluing of the AI bubble. And that's not a problem unless some people are in the business of actually building a bunch of data centers. Which means that if they are to go up to 100% in value, they got to match that physically, at least to keep up appearances. So what do they do? Build a shit ton of data centers. This is exactly what they're doing. They're building so many. And as a leftist mildly interested in economics, I want to posit that this makes no fucking sense if we are still an empire. Because empires take land to extract labor and resources from them. And America did this for the past 70 years as we de-industrialized, but we industrialized the global south to extract more labor and resources from them. But instead of doing that, we are engaged in a nationalist economics of autarky, where the most important thing is that the industries are in our homeland. So it makes no economic sense, but within the political context, ceasing to be an empire and falling into an autarkic fascist regime makes a whole lot of sense. And this becomes much more clear, this whole analysis, when you start thinking about what a data center is and the current politics of those things. As a data center is just a bunch of specialized chips, and it just so happens that American proxy state, Taiwan, controls one of the most valuable productions of semiconductors in this world, which means America, as it has been doing for the past 30 years, heavily influences who gets access and who doesn't get access to those chips. A bunch of American investors are heavily over-investing in an American asset that helps us project power. Sounds pretty imperial to me, right? So you realize that chips are made out of rare earths, and if you project power against China, you lose access to most of the rare earths in the world. So this gambit doesn't make sense from the raw materials which we will lose access to. The artificially constrained expertise that we have forced only into Taiwan and the Netherlands, through hosting industry in the imperial core when it should be hosted in the global south, without even mentioning that it doesn't have the demand of actual AI services that would justify it, or that China is beating us in it. I'm not an expert and there is so much more to be said, but this is insane.",

What actually functions is directly intervening with the mechanics of fascism and removing their ability to starve you and your family if you do. And so what does that actually look like? Well, there is great work being done, organizing things like ice watch, cop watch that will warn immigrants if there is ice around. There are people training their neighbors to defend themselves legally and physically from overreaching fascist authorities. There are mutual aid organizations like Food Not Bombs and street medics that are providing necessary aid to the infrastructure that would do those direct actions. And all this really requires is you to find a few friends that are down and go and do things. Help your neighbors, meet your neighbors, defend your neighbors.

    "text": "What the fuck is leftist problem with no kings day? Don't they understand that something needs to get done? Even if it's not perfect? Yes, we do. Now hear me out. Because we agree, leftist and liberals, that something must be done. We are both terrified and horrified by the rise of fascism in America. And we agree that something must be done. The biggest fear, the high level fear, and why we are so cynical of things like no kings is because of co-optation. And what does that mean? I understand it actually hasn't been well explained by many edgy leftists, but this is generally the concern. Which is that organizations that are just responding to the symptoms of fascism, the particular brutality of this fascist regime, will fail to undermine the systems that built fascism and undermine the systems that perpetuated violence for the past 70 years. And even if you disagree with me on what those systems are, what they look like, what to be done, I think in respect that that's a real fear. There is a very serious concern that if we get a massive movement that is actually effective at undermining this particular fascist leader, what bad faith actors in power will do is replace him with another quieter one. So the aim of a movement responding to fascism should not just be no kings, not a return to status quo, but an undermining of the status quo that led us to this moment. And obviously as a leftist, I think the system that led us to this moment is imperial capitalism. And I am extremely concerned when I see a group of people that are allegedly against fascism, waving Israeli flags, or saying we shouldn't wave Palestinian flags. So that's the high level critique and why we approach all of these parades with extreme caution. The other ones are that pushing people into parades as opposed to more escalated direct action can act as a pressure valve for this type of anti-fascist work. That's not an argument against the parades, but it is once again a reason to enter them critically. There are other more organizational and tactical disagreements working with the cops, puts our neighbors at risk. Not pushing for masks to be worn, puts our neighbors at risk. And idealizing non-violence when the people we are working against are happy to be violent, puts our neighbors at risk. So those are actual substantive critiques on a tactical level. Whereas the high level ones come down to two things, which is that this risks building a fascist movement that does not have the correct aims, or if it even has the correct aims is completely feckless because it pushes people into ineffective action. The job of leftists is to take this energy and make it as effective and well-oriented as possible. And I need your help as liberals or people that identify as liberals to just understand why we're doing that. It's not because we don't want to help, it's not because we don't care, it's not because we sit on our ass. It's because the action that's being taken has very real risks, very real consequences that actually matter.",

    "text": "Hey leftists, we all know about the liberal parade going on tomorrow, right? Called No Kings, where a bunch of people go out in the streets and pretend that screaming into the air will end fascism. Well, it's rightly received a lot of leftist criticism, but I also want to offer that it is an opportunity. And while critique is fantastic, action is notably better. And so let's look at what this actually is. A large parade of mobilized, angry liberals who have identified a problem, fascism, authoritarianism, and are looking for solutions. And the best thing we can do is offer them there. So there are lots of leftist organizations I know that are tabling at these events, trying to take mobilized angry liberals putting their energy into making signs and push them into parading or protesting at intervention points like in front of ICE detention facilities or into building effective mutual aid community defense or community organizing events. Now, there's a massive caveat here, which is that many of these events are using the cops, which means it is unsafe for many people, especially minorities and oppressed folks, to go. But I do just as a leftist immediately think, when there's a lot of cops doing one thing, it means they're not doing other things. So all I suggest is that we look at this for what it is and not what it pretends to be. It is not the protest or revolution that will take over the fascist regime. But it is a gathering point of a lot of people who are angry and have half of the right answer. Let's use it for what it is.",

But what if I told you that it was Iran that takes the most by far? And then Turkey? Because over a third of the asylum seekers in the world are hosted by these five countries. It's not even really close. Iran has 3 million. Turkey has almost 3 million. The United States is all the way the fuck down here with 400,000. Yet by and large, when you think about asylum taking countries, you think about asylum as a problem for Western, predominantly white countries. Not as a general issue of displaced people from violence that Western and white countries tend to cause, being solved and the brunt of which is being taken by the very same countries that the West hates. And that is intentional. Because when we talk about asylum in America, in the UK, in France, we're not talking about the actual global system of asylum. We're talking about racist reactions to the very, very limited part that France is willing to play in that. And so never let them gaslight you. They are not interested in protecting asylum seekers. They are not scared of taking asylum seekers. They are interested in using them as political ponds. Don't fucking fall for it.",

So I'll repeat this offer, at least so you can publicly reject it. Jubilee, I'm happy to consider going on on the condition that any conversation I'm a part of, it doesn't have to be the whole conversation just where I am, is given to me fully to share. This is the law in the EU, it should be the law in the US, and I don't understand why it wouldn't be standard business policy.

Being able to understand why is essential to being able to effectively combat the Gestapo as it stands and as it develops. Because we do not heckle protest and occasionally self-defend from ICE and National Guardsmen and Border Patrol because they are individually bad people. But because the position they occupy in society is in many cases directly opposed to the dignity and fundamental human rights of us and our comrades. But also because we want to make joining that case and staying in that position as unprofitable as possible. Because the fascist regime is spending 109 billion to make it as profitable as possible. You see how that has nothing to do with whether they had other choices, whether they're good or bad people, whether they were forced into it? It is a pure function of the system. So that is where anger comes in. But empathy is necessary because if we want them to leave we need to build alternative systems. We need to make sure that someone's choice is not joining the Gestapo and feeding their children. We must build mutual aid networks that help people get out of fascist Gestapo. And this is what, by the way, the Antifa work that no one is talking about. A lot of it is building networks where fascists, you don't have to forgive them, but you can allow them to leave. Because that's what we want. They're not my crimes to forgive, but they're also not my crimes to indict. But they are the enemies of the communities that I am in and care about and providing them alternatives and making those alternatives as beneficial as opposed to horrible as staying in Gestapo can be is the job that we need to be doing.",

This is not me being ungrateful for whatever peace has approached if it is worth celebrating, it's worth celebrating, but let's recognize it for what it is. It is not a gift from on high of the civilized nations giving to uncivilized Palestinians. It is the empire giving concessions to the resistance and their allies putting pressure on them and thinking they can slow down those concessions if they just quiet down for a little. If they wait long enough for Hamas to mess up or the gangs that Israel funds to be effective, maybe they can have an excuse to ramp back up violence. Maybe they won't get the same pushback, maybe the threat to Israel as a colony's existence will calm down. But we won't, because we've seen appeasement before and appeasing fascists doesn't fucking work.",

As state violence, fascism, and oppression become more and more extreme in this country, those who are normal or even vaguely moral have an imperative to become extreme. Because what it means to be extreme is just defined by what the mean is. And so if we recognize there is a good contingent of America that are actively engaged in fascistic and white supremacist politics, the opposition to that is extreme. If we maintain this framework that uses the term extremist to characterize both the people we are fighting and the people who are fighting back against it, we will lose because we will demonise people for doing what must be done to undermine fascism. If we maintain that framework, we allow those with power, we allow those that get to define the narrative, to define what is moral. Because extremism, once again, is just defined by what people believe in society. So if you can buy a lot of influence over what people believe in society, you can label the rest extremists.

Because that's actually what's happening. We know that. They've done this every time. It's not worth explaining to you again and again and again that war-mongering fascists don't care about hostages. Or if they do, it is only caring about hostages because they need excuses to continue their genocide. Israel is lying. The Arab states complicit with Israel are lying. America is lying. And even if they are willing to take some temporary setbacks in their aim of genocide as many Palestinians as possible, we should never forget that that is the goal, that is the aim that maintains the ethno-state of Israel, and it is the very violence that maintains and it was founded upon. So as long as the Palestinian people celebrate a ceasefire, I will celebrate right along with them. But we should never, ever, ever forget the only thing that even vaguely forced these concessions was effective resistance by the Palestinian people and strong international allyship and support that applied as much conceivable pressure to Israel that they thought this was the best way to continue their genocide rather than doing so openly. Never forget that and never let the boot off their neck.",

    "text": "Hi, I'm Will, Will's back up in Will's talks across platforms. You might recognize me from political debates, globe dating if you're a real OG or political takes. And I need your help to keep the audience that I've built over the past five years on TikTok and one year on Instagram. Because I don't want it to be Zuckerberg or now Larry Ellison's choice, what y'all see or who I have access to, I want it to be ours. So the best thing that you can do right now, and I'm sorry for being another one of these people, is go follow my sub-stack. And I know I'm sorry, I hate the sub-stack plugs just as much as you, but it genuinely is beneficial because once I have your email, not even sub-stack can take that away. And you can set it, if you don't want to read my articles, you can set it to only send once a month or once a week so that you don't get spammed, but I can still contact you if I get banned on TikTok and I need to send out an RSS link to my content. I can still proliferate the content that can be reposted or spread because we're quickly approaching a world where leftist ideas are actively suppressed in America to a large extent on digital platforms. And I'm by no means the largest victim, and that's not my goal here, but I do want to build up resilience. So the best thing you can do right now is go follow my sub-stack. It's the same act as my Instagram will stalks. This will allow me to one, keep the audience that I've already built. Two, build a better, more resilient audience where I don't have to be as reactive. I can build long form, effective content that I care about and want to be out there. I think my audience will like more than the very reactive Mimi content I have to make here to get on the algorithm. Two, it will allow me to support community members I want to. If one of my comrades on here get blocked, banned or suppressed, I can spread their content there because I think you'll all like it. And fourth and finally, if you would like to financially support me, sub-stack is the best place you can do it. I'm going to be doing monthly live like Q&As with my sub-stack subscribers, but mainly it just supports my content across multiple platforms if you want to support me if you think it's valuable. There are 10 trillion other places for your money to be going, but if that is where you want to, please give to Mutual Aid and then to me. So I hope you see the vision. I'm going to be releasing articles weekly if you're interested in sub-stack. I'm going to be doing a weekly write up of my short form content, kind of three reflections on things I've talked about, and then a monthly one. But most importantly, this is a community that I care about what y'all want. I mean, I'm sending you an email. I want to know what emails you want. So I want to build content for y'all. And so if you go follow me on sub-stack, if you go common on my things like I want to see this or I don't want to see this, I'll react. I see it. So yeah, this is a lot more earnest than I'm used to being online and it'll be pinned so everyone will see it. But it would mean the most if I can build a following on sub-stack that I just simply can't lose. That gives us a lot of power. That gives you a lot of power. So thank you so much. And let's fucking do this thing.",

Peter Teal's father owned a uranium mine in occupied Namibia. Stephen Hatfield, senior advisor at HHS, had his medical license in Rhodesia. Yeah, the pariah state that was too racist for even America to publicly support. So it is important to remember that not only did Nazis never go away, but the perpetrators of the war crimes of apartheid never went away. Many of them went to England, Australia, or America. And now a shit ton of them are coming into power. And as a final note, you might be asking me, Will, I don't blame people for the crimes of their father. Fine, if they disavowed it. But both Elon and Peter Teal have promoted the white genocide myth that is promoted by Afro-Connors currently in non-apartheid South Africa. So as the great thinko of our time, Charli XeX said, the apple don't fall far from the tree.",

The fact that genuinely progressive candidates are not getting the support of the establishment, merely because they labeled themselves socialists, is that purity politics? Right? Because you're violating the one like pure rule in the Democratic Party, which is you can't recognize reality. And interestingly, every single person that booed at the person Hackling Commala was engaged in purity politics, you were shaming them for violating the respectability of the event. Purity politics is a thing, it does exist. But it's not unique of leftism. And actually, I would say, leftists, or, in my view, the people willing to work with the most diverse coalition. The vast majority of leftists I know have worked with liberals, right? Who are wildly different than them? The vast majority of leftists I know actually have been in coalition with Republic Democrats, on the other hand, are simply allergic to allying themselves with leftists. They have expelled them from their party, they have silenced them at their conventions, and they have not supported them, though they won primaries. If we want to talk about purity politics, we need to talk about where it's actually fucking coming from.",

And I just want to know, this is about heckling Commola, where I do think we should heckle every war criminal, including the former vice president of the United States, but beyond that, I don't actually think you'll give a fuck about efficacy. Right? Like, if you really did believe in a large tent for the Democratic Party, you would be pulling in leftists. You beg leftists not to show you attack, you criticize, you echo you, and yet the second we do, right, the second we break your respectability politics, we get booed, we get expelled from parties, we are not allowed to speak of the DNC, this is not like y'all being super reasonable and us being totally unreasonable. Actually, the vast majority of leftists I know, number one, did vote for Commola, and number two, are extraordinarily involved in local elections. And think a lot about how effective politics works. Almost every pure blue-magged Democrat I know doesn't. Because once again, this conversation isn't between people that want to value every piece of political tactics or are actually willing to compromise the values and morals for efficacy and undermining fascism. It's one side that doesn't actually understand how to undermine fascism and the other side that is screaming, screaming and begging and pleading for y'all to be effective in undermining fascism. So it is deeply frustrating when that screaming, begging and pleading is met with moralism and outrage at the idea that one of those tactics just annoys you. Because there's no tactical benefit to shitting on leftists for attacking Commola. Right, actually, no one has articulated a benefit. It's just that y'all are annoyed. I can articulate a benefit to heckling Commola. So once again, uneven, y'all are mad, we're effective. Join us, not y'all.",

    "text": "And, and you know, I sometimes think about, you know, I am not president of the United States. And yet, you're still a war criminal. If you don't want to be heckled, don't go in public and don't be a war criminal. And I'm going to repeat this until Blue Maga gets it in their head, that we will heckle and should heckle every single war criminal who dares enter public and comment on politics as if they have any moral standing to do so. And you're going to repeat the same fucking claims, so I'll preempt them. The organization that did this code pink has heckled almost every other war criminal. They do heckle Trump. They do heckle the billionaires who, by the way, are also not in office, but yet still have influence. Climate defiance has heckled comma and Trump and Biden and Obama. Be heckled Kissinger and Cheney, because when a war criminal doesn't turn themselves into the egg, they are escaping justice. So the best we can do is force them out of the public sphere or discredit them as they should be. Number two, the slightly better one, which is you should use any energy you would use to protest Kamala to protest Trump. Cool. You should use all the energy you're using to defend Kamala to protest Trump. Because I would argue protesting Kamala, net positive, right, reminds us that war crimes are bad. You defending a war criminal. Not so much. Both are using energy. Three, some people are still lying that she's not a war criminal. She was part of the administration that helped perpetrate a genocide. The only way you do that and not become a war criminal is resign and turn yourself into the egg the second that you realize it's a genocide. She didn't do that. And she's actually still yet to recognize the genocide that she did. So she's a war criminal who's still standing by her war crimes and commenting on politics. I think it's perfectly fair for us to comment on her politics whenever she did that. Dare do that. And this idea that she's somehow getting like special attention or like we're just on hung up on her is not true. The only reason these get more attention than other heckling is because she actually is a really large public figure and has an army of deeply uncritical supporters that will attack and destroy anyone who dare question the war crimes she did. And I swear to God, I'm going to get them on this video. I got them on the last video I did. And so if you are telling me that I'm misplacing my energy, I would like to ask you to ask you first why you think energy defending Kamala if she really doesn't matter in politics is well placed. Because we're not the only ones that are obligation to be tactical with our energy. So do you. And by the way, I voted for Kamala and I never told anyone not to vote for Kamala. And I would argue uncritical blue maga was the biggest aversion to people doing good things in electoralism because you destroyed any critical discussion about electoralism in a empire that is committing war crimes. Thank you.",

He's fucking dooping every single person that is still yapping about peaceful protests or yapping about civil dialogue because they don't fucking believe that. Fascists don't believe in civil dialogue. And so if you are admitting Trump is a fascist, that means you stop engaging in civil dialogue, that means you stop pretending they're following the rules. You still hold them to account of the rules. You still accept out the expectations. But you don't act surprised when they don't follow them. And you don't keep following them when it injures your ability to fight against them. I think most clearly articulated, the most frustrating thing I am seeing in the political realm right now is verbally calling a Trump a fascist, verbally saying mag as a fascist movement, but being unwilling to treat it as one.",

While the legal system is fucked up, absolutely corrupt, and slowly approaching uselessness, this is a genuine choke point that citizens can have on the complete weaponization and brutalization that is happening of the legal system, which is simply not complying. If you are on this jury, you don't have to give a reason for saying they shouldn't be indicted, you don't have to give a reason for saying they're innocent, you just have to give it. And defense attorneys in court cannot tell you this. If prosecution lawyers know that you intend to do this, they will try and get you off the jury, but if it's not brought up, at the point at which you vote, just vote correctly.

As Donald Trump labels any anti-Christian, anti-capitalist, or anti-American sentiment as possibly correlated to political violence. When in fact, all of those are necessary to characterize political violence. But this is not new, and it is more than recognized both the continuities and the ruptures, because terrorism has always been an idea used exclusively against those that opposed state violence. And so it is not surprising, as state violence massively ramps up, those that oppose it are increasingly labeled terrorists. And so while the severity, targeted brutality, changes, my suggestion doesn't, we must abandon the framework created to justify state violence against those that oppose the interests of the state and recognize this word for what it is, an excuse to oppress, attack, and undermine whomever the state would like.",

So if you'll forgive me for explaining a joke, I want to just outline why some leftists have angst with this and how to alleviate that angst. Because street theaters not new, leftists and artists, even MS, have used it at protests to gain attention. Defuse violence and generally diffuse information effectively. And it also just makes protests more fun. More people come, more people are energized and mobilized when you're doing fun things. There's no doubt about that and I want that to be central. But the concern is that it doesn't take the issue seriously enough and that it can cause co-optation into liberals. I.e. if we talk about the frogs, we forget that actually this is a very serious issue when like self-defense and things that fascists would call violence might at points be necessary. And so if your focus is always look how peaceful the frogs are, at some point they have to stop being peaceful because ice isn't. While I'm very pro-fun, what we need to remember when we're consuming this content as all things that bring dopamine is we must do so responsibly. We must remember that this is a front for effective protesting. We remember that the frogs are there to distract you from the black block doing the real work. The frogs are there to draw in your attention, get you out there so that other fun things can happen. You know what I mean? Great. So if your bag is going out in an inflatable thing and making fun of ice and getting eyes on the protest, fantastic. If your bag is getting as many radical frogs to protect you when you're running away from illegalized custody, also based and funny.",

So no, you can't be for the people doing the thing and against the thing. It's like you can't be patriotic for America and actually condemn the genocide's Americas happened. You cannot love the genocide or hate the genocide. It does not work. You must reject the radical nationalism that we have been taught to actually undermine the harms of that nation. You can love the hills in England and Wales and Scotland, if you want. You can love the geography, you can love the people, but loving Britain as a political construct, which is what Britain is, is impossible without accepting the politics of that construct.

But also, morally, you keep doing the good thing. You keep attempting to give people food who are starving, because that is better than not trying. Because every time you don't, it's not your moral failing that criminals stopped you, it's theirs. So don't keep letting power determine your morals. You can engage in the real world how it actually is, and work as hard as possible for how it ought to be, and continually hold those people that do evil things to account, even if it is perfectly predictable that evil people and evil countries and evil systems will do evil things.",

    "text": "Millions of people around the globe suffer from not being able to understand the concept of average. If you say- This is conservative gaslighting. And I know I sound like the woke friend when I explain this, but stick with me. Because even in this video, they go on to just repeat a bunch of stereotypes, showing that when people say, on average, men are stronger than women, on average, these people are smarter than these people. They are simply using, on average, as a excuse to repeat a stereotype. And then when you point out that that stereotype is not a helpful model for the world, because it doesn't actually predict how strong someone is, for example, they're being a strong woman, they'll go, well, don't you understand what I'm saying is on average they are? But that's not all they're saying, right? Because no one cares what the average is. Are we collecting all the men and seeing how much they can lift? No, we're trying to understand in a society how to treat a man or how to treat a woman. And when they sew on average men are showing me the women, women, they're saying we should treat women as weak. And the response, which is saying, so well, some women are strong, is saying no, we should treat people as they are. Not what we expect from the gender or race or ethnicity. But do you see the trick there? They never said what they actually meant. And so you responding to what they actually meant makes you look crazy. There's no controversy in averages, but there's also very little political value in averages. But they can avoid being held accountable to the political statement they're making, which is we should treat people on the basis of their race, sex, gender, whatever, differently by merely pointing to a pretty relevant fact, which is on average those people are different. It's a slide of hand, it's an nasty one, and it's a gas-lighting one. And it's one of the many that are used to just shoehorn stereotypes back into this public.",

With the deification of military, the silence of any dissent against cops, and the consistent repeated lie that we have a crime problem, when violent crime has been going down for the past 30 years. And the most dangerous people to be around are the cops. And they did this intentionally, because the violence was always going to ramp up. There was no game plan that demilitarized America without massively remilitarizing it. And we are just seeing that happen. We are being invaded by the very war machine that has been built up for the past 30 years, and we need to treat it as such. And that means building effective communal, mutual aid and community defense organizations that can actually be resilient when someone is thrown in jail unjustly. And a good metric for this is if you are more worried about the legality of what ICE is doing. Rather than your community's ability to defend from what ICE is doing, you have your priorities in the wrong place. I know it is scary, I know it is uncomfortable, and I know it doesn't feel good. But we need to focus on not fixing the system that caused this, but developing systems that can end this.",

Because Barry Weiss is not a journalist, the Free Press was almost singularly interested on promoting far-right conspiracy theories, supporting Israel, defaming trans people, and undermining basically every liberal institution in America. And not only is Barry Rice a despicable, trans-phobic, bigot, the fact that Paramount, which is currently trying to get a merger approved by the FTC, felt they needed to politically appoint this bigot to a position of power over CBS a large media network, is extremely concerning to anyone who pretends to care about free speech, like Barry Weiss does. Anyone who is interested in your media not being singularly bigoted, right-wing hateful media, or anyone who has ever read any of the garbage that comes out of Barry Weiss' mouth. We are at the stage of fascism where the media is capitulating and putting their propagandists in front of your face. You should be paying attention.

And that is why the right wing is obsessed with pushing things into the marketplace of ideas. While they consistently say shit, we know they don't believe. I can point you to ten trillion ways that prove this. You probably agree. But for example, abortion. The right wing used to be pro-abortion because it helped the racism. And then it was a way to split the Democratic Party and they moved away from it in our anti-abortion. This is most stark when you see people that have fallen for their propaganda actually take it to the logical conclusion. There's a great clip of a very real actual like ethno-nationalist racist talking to Charlie Kirk and taking Charlie Kirk's white supremacy and to the natural conclusion, which is that only white people should be in America and Charlie Kirk backs off. And that's because people like Charlie Kirk are not saying things because they believe them. I don't really care if they believe them. They're saying them because they help with power. And so the reaction to that is not to point out that if they're lying, they don't care. And they might agree with you. Donald Trump is pro-choice. We know that. The reaction to that is to stop legitimating their lies and then involves not debating and legitimating it and then building power against it.

    "text": "I want to ask you something. If ICE is illegally detaining you, do you have the right to self-defense? And second of all, do you right now feel comfortable saying that you do in public? As the correct answer in a civil functioning liberal democracy would be that if a federal agent that has limited powers to arrest is acting illegally outside of those powers to arrest, you do have the right to self-defense because they're not anything other than a random person in that context. And second of all, and I think more tellingly, you should be perfectly comfortable saying that is your fundamental right as a person to self-defense against illegal kidnapping. But somehow, though it's in window on this, has shifted massively. No one on the establishment Democratic Party is saying that you have a right to self-defense against ICE illegal detentions. No one. No one's saying that immigrants should be armed to stop these random, primarily men illegally kidnapping them. And so while from the establishment there is some perro-clutching about the violence that they helped create, the solution is really, really obvious. Which is that we should propagate, maintain, and promote the self-defense over these people who are being illegally kidnapped and brutalized. I say this not just because I personally want to do that, because I want you to notice how much you have internalized the ideological violence that is being committed against the concept of self-defense. By that I mean, we have been attacked and labeled terrorists and labeled instigators and labeled violent for seeing violence being committed against people and saying that those people have the right to defend themselves. So much so it's outside of the almost complete over-tune window of mainstream American politics, even though if you ask anyone they will say that they believe in self-defense. So I think it's not only important that we internally believe this, but also if you're the material abilities, I mean some people can't risk being labeled a terrorist, but if you can, go out and say it. Say you can self-defense against a policeman. Say you can self-defense against an ICE person who is clearly obviously and consistently acting illegally.",

And the fascist meaty machine is going to create new justifications, be it drugs or authoritarian regimes or mistreatment of civilians.

A center of this in your mind should always be, Trump is lying because war is helpful to him. War is helpful to him because it distracts you from his fascistic domestic policies, because it unites a nation from an otherwise unpopular president, because it justifies massively increasing funding of violence workers. So while you might at times catch me trying to undermine some of the myths that they make up, I want you to remember, they aren't saying them because they think they're true. They're saying them because they're helpful. And if we prove this one wrong, they're just going to move to another one.

Because this is the preamble, it starts with we the people form a more perfect union. The definition of a democracy is a system of governments by the whole population or eligible members of a state, typically through elected officials. That's what we have when we the people are making the state. A republic is typically a democracy, the spring power is held by people in their elected representatives, rather than a monarch. So America is a constitutional democratic republic because the power is held ultimately by the people through their elected officials and it has a constitution. I think constitution adds nothing every state has a constitution, but that's neither here nor there. As a final conceptual note, there can be democratic constitutional monarchies. England is a democratic constitutional monarchy. The power is ultimately with the people, but the monarch is existent and therefore it's not a republic. As I always say, you all don't actually give a fuck. The reason this talking point is repeated is not because of some semantic misunderstanding about republic and democracy, whatever. You don't care. The reason you're repeating this is because it allows you to expel the concept of liberal democracy from your politics, which is very helpful when you have a stoppo violating the fundamental rights that is established in that constitution you claim to care about on the daily. It's very important to you that you can ignore those liberal democratic principles that are actually in the constitution that you claim to venerate so that you can violate them every day. So no, we're a constitutional democratic republic. If you gave a shit with those words meant, you would know that, but you don't.",

Those are Republican virtues. I mean, I'm not saying they're bad things, but they are things that Republicans and conservatives and sometimes liberals use. And ignoring that they are used in that way in our political climate is not like a gotcha moment. It is a lack of media literacy. So yeah, Taylor Swift's new album is clearly political, right? Even if it's not intentionally so. And it's political in exactly the politics that likes to hide itself, which is conservatism. Further, doing this album, which is basically like a victory lap that is bad, all people are literally being disappeared by a Gestapo. There is a genocide going on and rising fascism in America is distasteful. It is distasteful to release an album that and have not commented on any of the bad shit going on that celebrates how ideal and good your life is.

It's the European Convention on Human Rights, and it protects the fundamental human rights of every member state, including the UK. They don't mention it because abolishing human rights in the United Kingdom isn't very popular. Second of all, this threatens the peace in Ireland. The Good Friday Agreement, which ended violence in Northern Ireland after a long period of English colonialism, was built upon the European Convention on Human Rights. It is built into the Good Friday Agreement. If you get rid of the ECHR, you undermine the very foundation of the Good Friday Agreement and peace in Northern Ireland. Three, they lie about this being a foreign court. It is not a foreign court. It is a court in a different country. Fine, but England is a member state, and it helped found the thing. The Conservatives are trying to get rid of the Convention on Human Rights because they want to violate people's human rights. That is the only conclusion here. And specifically, the people they want to violate the human rights of are immigrants. They want to deport them faster. They say this in that video. But even if you can't bring yourself to give a fuck about asylum seekers, God forbid, having due process for asylum, realize this protects a lot of your rights. Your rights in prison, if you get thrown in jail, your rights to due process, your rights to environmental things. And so them throwing this away to throw immigrants onto the bus will throw you under the bus just with them. If threatens peace in Ireland, they're lying about it being a foreign court, and they're too much whims to admit what they're doing. This is concerning. It's dangerous.

Bush as well, Ronald Reagan. Because liberalism is simply the ideology of capitalism, the ideology of maintenance of empire. Fascism is the ideology of expansion of empire. It is how you justify expanding and colonizing. But liberalism is how you justify maintaining those colonies. And this is precisely how Israel maintained itself, the idea that it's a light in a savage world, just so happens to be labeling all the brown people's savages. That's not an accident. That's intentional. But George W. Bush did the same thing. He justified slaughtering over two million Iraqis on the basis of decency, bringing democracy when he was doing just the opposite. And Biden and Kamala did the same thing when they justified slaughtering Palestinians using American, made, manufactured, and funded weapons by Israel in the name of self-defense, in the name of international order. Despite themselves undermining the international order, the term liberal and conservative in America is divorced from the political scientific term of liberal. What we mean by liberal is people that support the ideology of capitalism, the ideology that capitalism made, the mythos, the ideas, the concepts that they create to justify the violence inherent in capitalism and therefore the violence inherent in imperialism. Trump ceases to be a liberal because he ceases with that veneer of liberalism. He gets rid of these lies about doing it for democracy and openly accepts he's doing it because he wants a strong renation because he believes in national greatness, whatever. And that is when the violence of capitalism becomes fascism. But never forget that it started and was hidden and very, very, very effective under liberalism.",

    "text": "This week, the FBI and Elon Musk condemned the ADL. This gives me hope, because it reminds me of the one major weakness of fascists, which is that everyone wants to be Hitler. And for those of you who don't know, the ADL is just another fascist-apologist-non-profit. A claim to be founded to stop the defamation of Jewish people and secure justice and fair treatment of all, while completely and entirely undermining that by having a strong support and visible advocacy for the apartheid state of Israel committing a genocide. You might know them from their banger of defending Elon Musk's Nazi salute? Because it's a delicate moment, presumably because Elon Musk is also a fundamental supporter of Israel. So yeah, their record consistently shows them siding with Israeli fascists over justice and fairness. And even that wasn't enough to save them from being condemned and attacked by the very people that they wrote super hard for. And this always reminds me of the one really big weakness of fascists, which is that everyone wants to be Hitler. They don't play nice together, and if you attack fascists who famously have super fragile egos and are based mostly on emotion, they will attack back even if that is not tactical. And attacking the ADL is not tactical. It is a great apologetics device for Israel. And so while we see this specter of nasty horrifying and powerful fascists in claiming of America, it is important not to mythologize them. They make mistakes, and they actually systemically make mistakes. And it is our job to make sure they make as many as possible. And this is one of them. And I perfectly aware this breaks the maximum from the art of war that you do not point out when your enemy makes a mistake. You don't think Elon Musk and AFBI are looking to me to make policy decisions, and if you are Elon, the only policy decision I have to you is to move back to South Africa.",

We already knew that, but that they are willing to do this openly and publicly. They knew that this would go to headlines and what I want you to think about is why they wanted it to. Because previously, Israel wouldn't. They would brutalize people, but they would lie or dismiss or undermine or justify it. They would do what liberals do, which is commit a shits on a violence, but then make up myths to justify it. We're a democracy. We're promoting liberalism. We're bombing them into being liberals, whatever. Israel's switching tactics. I would call it the Ben Gviratactic. Fascism, which is instead of denying, undermining or dismissing violence that is necessary to the system they're creating, to glorify it, to find identity and joy in it. That's my theory. And the political value of that is quite obvious. It galvanizes the people that support you to do more violence. And if your state needs a huge upswell in violence to maintain itself or justify itself, that's what you want. And that is precisely what the Netanyahu government wants. And I would say is the necessary consequence of what Israel is. And by the way, it's also what Trump wants. And I think a necessary consequence of what America is. Because both of these states are founded on violence. And if you deny, ignore or justify violence for long enough, you stop doing it. There's a contradiction there that can't last for long enough. And so what you need is people that aren't contradictive. And fascists for all their idiocies are not contradictory. They admit they're doing violence. Ben Gvirat openly says he is an ethno nationalist. And you need those people when the contradictions of liberalism go too far. When no longer can you justify, deny or undermine it. You need to start valuing it and enjoying it. And I think that's the transition that's happening in Israel. And I think it's transition that happened in Rhodesia and South Africa. And I think it's what's happening in America. And that's important, not just theoretically high-minded. It's also relevant because it changes the strategies you deal with them with. Liberals, it is helpful to undermine the myths that they're spreading. It is helpful to say you're lying. Fascists kind of stop lying. And at some point you have to stop debating them. And you have to start building power to undermine them. And that's precisely the transition we need with undermining the sub-ular colonial genocide going on by Israel.",

And yet it feels almost immoral to turn the righteous anger that comes from every single time someone dies drunk driving towards the system that caused it rather than the individual in that system that actuated that risk. And this isn't saying you shouldn't be angry at a person that makes an evil or wrong decision, but it is saying we know that that anger won't turn into change, whereas if that anger and work and effort and political drive is pushed toward changing the system, we know that if the system changed, there would be less people dying from drunk driving. And this is what left us mean by de-individuating politics. We are much much less interested in the individual evil actor anywhere in a political system. Then we are in the political and economic system as a whole. We have auto-based industry, someone will drunk drive. That person could be bad, evil, stupid or reckless, but demonizing them doesn't help. Even if it's justified, it's not helpful. And this can be applied to a bunch of different contexts. And actually, it makes me extraordinarily empathetic to people engaged in wrong and harmful behavior because all of us at some point do. And so while I could spend my energy demonizing attacking or undermining them, and if it personally affected me, I probably would. As a political actor trying to have change, the focus should be on the system. And specifically for drunk driving, the change is obvious, changing to public transit saves lives. And yet pointing that out when someone is harmed from drunk driving is attacked and undermined and seems as undermining the justice that needs to be served. When in my view, it's exactly the justice the person deserves.",

And I don't think my vote did much at all. I lived in North Carolina, there was no chance in hell that was flipping, but to you, that's all that matters. To me, I view politics as a series of different strategies. And one of those strategies is having a social expectation that we do not allow war criminals to continue living in our society as normal. And holding that standard universally equips us and helps us build communities to attack all war criminals, including the ones that happened to be in power at the time. Right now, it is Trump that is in large amounts of power, but we need to also pressure Democrats to use the little power they do have against him. And building a society and a community and protest organizations that protested all war criminals universally arms us against the very fascism that you want us to focus on right now. And the fact that this is not obvious is fine, but the fact that you don't get that, and you are antagonistic to the people that do, means you are not actually, number one, doing the work to undermine fascism because it becomes very clear when you actually start working on organizing against fascism that you needed to start about 10 years ago under neoliberalism. And number two, that you still identify with the war criminals that us attacking Kamala Harris or Joe Biden or any of the other hundreds of war criminals prior to them feels like an attack on you. But it's not, you didn't commit genocide and you don't have to defend them in that way. And in fact, attacking them, undermining them, holding them to account as we should all war criminals helps us undermine fascism, whereas defending the neoliberal establishment that helped produce Trump, help build the resentments that Trump used to build fascism in America, hurts the fight against fascism, brow-beating leftist who have always been the center of movements against fascism, hurts that fight against fascism. Not the opposite way around.",

    "text": "Have you ever heard a Zionist say that the International Criminal Court has no jurisdiction over Netanyahu? Maybe not, I've recognized that's a little niche, but stick around to figure out why that's just so stupid. First of all, Zionists say this because Israel is not a member of the International Criminal Court, and therefore technically has no treaty obligations to the ICC. And, the ICC has no jurisdiction over Israeli territory. And these things are true. Israel is internationally recognized as a state, unfortunately, and by the way, it should stop being recognized, but that's a different argument. But it is recognized and it has sovereignty over its territory. That doesn't prevent other states from being able to arrest a person who committed a crime in their territory. And that's precisely what the ICC's jurisdiction relies on, because you know who is a member of the ICC? Palestine. Palestine is the signatory of the Rome Statute, because it also is an internationally recognized state. And Israel and Netanyahu have committed their crimes in Palestine. So Palestine is enforcing its domestic jurisdiction, its enforcement jurisdiction themselves. And by being a signatory of the ICC, the ICC is able to direct the enforcement of that enforcement jurisdiction. So it's not the ICC having jurisdiction over Israel. It's Palestine having jurisdiction over its own goddamn territory. And then handing that jurisdiction to the ICC to enforce. And also it's important that they get that jurisdiction through the ICC, because Netanyahu, once again, for better or for worse, is a sitting head of state. And therefore in some cases he would get immunity. But a major exception to that immunity is here with me now, international tribunals. Because obviously we don't want states randomly prosecuting other states head of state. But an international tribunal with a large membership, probably fine. This is quite complicated and I've simplified it a lot. I can make it longer and more expansive. But hopefully that was clear. If you have any questions about it, please ask me. And as always, not legal advice. I'm not an expert in this. This is my understanding from an undergraduate level. Just to be clear, they would have jurisdiction anyway, because genocide is a crime of universal jurisdiction, meaning anyone has an obligation to enforce it. As long as they don't have immunity, which they avoid by having an international tribunal. Thank you.",

They're attempting to open up a humanitarian corridor because Israel is illegally blockading Gaza to perpetuate a mass genocide of Palestinians, so all eyes on Gaza, because Israel has already taken hostages from this smooth floatylet. Because every piece of pressure, attention, and effort needs to be mobilized together. Italy is already calling a general abstract, per its largest union.

Because if there isn't, they would do what they did to previous Flotillas. Just bomb them. And that, that teeny little morsel should give us a little bit of hope. Because it means they are scared. If they're changing how they're acting, if they're trying to seem more humane, it means that seeming humane at least matters.

    "text": "Reaching the naval bloodshade violates the transnational law. No, it very obviously does not, but I want to break down just how laughable this claim is, because they have to know it and they can't believe it. But first, let's recognize Israel doesn't give a fuck about international law. If they did, they would buy by the binding security council resolutions requiring them to disclose their nuclear armaments. So we've established that their cause blame, but let's sit and laugh at their cause play a little bit more, because their claim right now is that a boat that is in international waters that is officially carrying humanitarian aid is violating international law by simply attempting to deliver that international aid through the territorial waters of the country they are illegally invading. And their only conceivable positive argument for why they have this right is self-defense, but that works positively, proportionally and necessarily. So they must prove that blocking this aid is both proportionate and necessary to their own self-defense. And there is absolutely no world in which blocking necessary humanitarian aid to civilians is necessary or proportionate to your defense. And borrowing the positive justification of self-defense, they have a negative obligation to not interfere with any ship on international water, which the Samut Flutilla was, any ship entering territorial waters that are not theirs, which the water outside of Gaza isn't, and especially any humanitarian mission. Here is triple violation here, brother, one of which is a positive obligation. You not only have an obligation to not fuck with humanitarian operations, you have an obligation to facilitate it as the invading and occupying force, which in July of 2024 the ICJ found Israel was. So let's break down just all the ways that they're incorrect here. Israel does not have the right to regulate the international waters at all. The only justification for doing that is direct necessary and proportionate self-defense. They have no argument for that here. Then they have no right to regulate territorial waters, which the Samut Flutilla was entering the territorial waters of Gaza. If they were entering territorial waters of Israel would be of a slightly different argument because you could even vaguely suggest that if what they were doing was illegal it could rightfully be regulated by Israel. But it's not, because it's not entering Israel's waters. And third, not only is it Gaza's territory, but Israel is an illegal occupying force per the ICJ in 2024. Therefore, not only do they have a negative obligation to not interfere with any commerce and certainly not humanitarian commerce entering here, but they actually have an obligation to allow and facilitate humanitarian commerce. So they are violating the sanctity of international water, the territorial integrity of Gaza, the political sovereignty of Gaza, the humanitarian rights of the Palestinian people, and their obligations as an occupying force. Every conceivable right or obligation they could have is being violated here. And that is simply by stopping the ships. Much less what they are doing now, which is attempting to sink the ships.",

According to their current livestream, which you should go watch on their channel or Middle Eastern eye, at least one of the boats has been illegally intercepted by Israel. This is Israel continuing to illegally block necessary and life-saving humanitarian aid to continue their illegal genocide and mass brutalization of Palestinians, all eyes on the smooth Fletilla and all eyes on Gaza as always.",

Because the second you accept that you have more of a right to be here, then anyone else on this planet merely because of where you were born, you must have the ideologies to justify that, and you're certainly willing to use some amount of force to enforce it. And you can't. There's no coherent ideology to justify that, it's nonsense, but because of that, the amount of force is equally arbitrary. So once you accept the arbitrary superiority of your own nationality, it is arbitrary the amount of force that is being used, and fascists will take that and fucking run. And that is what we're seeing. Liberals gave an inch. They said, yeah, maybe we should have borders, because you know, I think Americans are good, and I think other cultures can occasionally be scary. And fascists said, oh yeah, cultures can be scary? Well, you know what we do with scary people. No, the only solution is to reject any type of nationalism and say, no, no, no, I'm no better than anyone because of where I'm born. And if you can use force against them from merely existing in America, you're going to use force against me from merely existing in America. So they're much more of my comrades than you ever will be, no matter where you were born. And this is why it's so frustrating to see anyone think we could ever appease a fascist, because in that very appeasement is the seed of violence fascists are using. Once you say you are better and more willing to be here than other people, they're right. You should use force. You should have a militarized border. You're just rejecting the conclusion of your own logic.",

Things like racing the federal minimum wage, creating universal 12-week paid parent-alive, free child care, or actually funding the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which fights for you. This is a platform launched by a genuinely grassroots organization called American Demand. Routes are demanding very simply a vision from the Democratic Party. And so while I, personally, demand a shit ton more, before I will endorse any person running for office in this empire, this is a well-fought out and pretty cohesive, bare minimum platform for any Democrat that is attempting to say they represent the people, and not just the people with private islands. So if you are slightly less cynical about electoralism than I am, and you are tired of blue or red maga asking you what you think the Democrats should have done, point them to these policies and ask them why the Democrats haven't already, because for a party that is meant to represent the people, they have absolutely no excuse for failing to deliver or even support a lot of these policies. Of course, and in my view most importantly, if we are going to build huge amounts of infrastructure to resist fascism, we have to know what at the very least are a hypothetical demand of policies for the system to work would look like. So I'm in long held and still held position is that electoralism and voting will not save us. As we use every level of power inside and outside the political system, we need a clear vision of what the political system working well would look like. And having some basic demands to make right now of any candidate that wants to say they are using electoralism for anti-fascist aims is a good starting point. And if you're less cynical and electoralism is your bag or you already work in it, please go check this out, they are well effective.",

Law is just the set of rules that determine how power is applied. And if in fact that power is applied unevenly, that is the law. And I would agree with you, international law, as it exists, is deeply uneven and quite colonial. But it does exist. And rejecting that it exists is not helpful, especially when it's on our side. And specifically with Israel, international law is on our side. The term genocide is a language of international law. We would not have it, and it certainly wouldn't have the same gravitas if it didn't have the institutions of international law behind it. Why the fuck if you're advocating for the freedom and self-liberation of Palestinians, would you dismiss international law? And even if it was politically beneficial, it's just not true.

The high risk zone is the zone that they think Israel is most likely to kidnap any legally seized, this legal necessary aid. And this is despite currently to my knowledge, three countries providing an escort to this civilian flotilla providing humanitarian aid, Turkey, Italy and Greece. And so while your eyes should always be on Gaza and working as hard as possible to prevent the continued violence, brutalization, dehumanization and genocide of these people, the Samut Flotilla will hopefully reach them. And if they do not, it will be yet another escalation of violence by Israel against the International Civil Society. It is not unexpected, but we should never be desensitized to it.",

These are two different organizations, one of which America is a part of the ICJ, and one of which America is not a part of the ICC. One of them prosecutes individuals, the ICC, the criminal court. One of them prosecutes states, the ICJ. Netanyahu does not have a warrant out for his arrest for genocide. The accusation in the ICC is a series of other war crimes, particularly using wet starvation as a weapon of war. Israel does have a charge against it for genocide, not as a war crime, but as a fundamental human rights violation under the genocide convention. This is not insanely important for the everyday person to know, but if you are making a point about talking about international law with Israel, it is worth it to get it right at the very least to demonstrate to the Zionist you are speaking to that you have any clue what you're talking about. And it is relevant for America's obligations, because strictly speaking, America is not a member of the ICC and does not have a treaty obligation to indict Netanyahu if they come. I would argue by merit of the genocide convention they have an obligation, but under the ICC because of the warrant, they don't. And so yeah, I recognize this is annoying and I recognize it doesn't matter that much, but if you're going to talk about it, do talk about it correctly, because at the very least, it makes us look more competent. The law is on our side, we just need to know it.",

So for example, if you give someone a gun and it is reckless as to whether they will engage in a crime with it, you can be found complicit. If you encourage them in doing a crime, even though you didn't exactly tell them how to do it, you can be complicit. Kamala Harris, as well as Trump, as well as the whole entire political establishment in the United States, encouraged Israel to attack Palestine. Not only did they encourage them, but there was bipartisan funding and weapons for them doing so. Meanwhile, almost every single human rights organization was telling them either that Israel was going to or already was committing a genocide or that there was some other series of massive historical backing for war crimes being committed by Israel with those weapons. Israel was already criminal prior to that and in violation of multiple non-proliferation treaties. Not only did Kamala Harris support actively, like she came out and said, we should be funding Israel's weapons more when she supported the bill Biden pushed. But her administration, the Biden-Harris administration, also through diplomatic ends, protected them from international sanctions. Do I think Kamala was particularly complicit compared to other people within the American establishment? To be frank, I don't care. But to deny that she's a war criminal is simply to not know what a war criminal is. I don't think this is the most important conversation right now. I don't think it should be the focus of politics right now. But all of you have spammed my comments incessantly simply lying. You can say we should vote for someone who is a war criminal because it's tactically necessary. But denying their crime is so deeply offensive to the people who suffered from that crime that I just simply cannot let it stand.",

And this is the complexity of it. If you haven't gone back and read this context, or if you just haven't talked to enough Nazis because you're lucky enough to have a life, you wouldn't know that there's a difference. And it's really hard to argue that like, this is what they're doing. But go read that comment section. You will see enough people using Nazi language because they are obviously disagreeing with my takes on fascism because they are notably more sympathetic to fascism than I am.

Because yeah, there's this plan going around that Trump just endorsed for a transitional Gaza authority headed by Tony Blair. This guy. Ah! And we don't know much, but from how I've seen it, it looks like this might try to resemble a trustee ship, which most generally are just territories that are occupied and run in good faith by a larger territory. Historically, it has been used for formerly colonized territories like Nimibia was the trust territory of South Africa. Intel Nimibia could establish this health governing government. He's developed out of the League of Nations mandates. The mandates, often if they hadn't already expired, became trust territories under the UN. Here are the League of Nations mandates as well as some of the Pacific Islands. This map alone should show you why this is such a bad fucking idea. Because Nimibia, which was the mandate territory of South Africa, and then became a trustee ship under South Africa, was abused to no end. A partite was enforced upon it. Its resources got extracted, and its people got attacked and brutalized, and illegally occupied following the expiration of the mandate, meaning following the time that South Africa should have been able to build a functioning government in Nimibia. And recently, only recently, Nauru, which was a trust territory between New Zealand, Australia, and the UK, just one occasion in the ICJ, because they stole millions of dollars worth of phosphate from Nauru while it was under the trustee ship. But the best example, and most relevant, might be fucking British Mandate Palestine. There's already been a British mandate in Palestine before. It went poorly. For those of you who don't know, British Mandate Palestine was what that territory was, prior to the establishment of the pseudo-state of Israel. And a large reason that the Zionist terrorists of the Haganat Irgunandahi were able to establish the Israeli entity is because the British Mandate Palestine, the British who were meant to occupy and protect the sovereignty of the people, fucking left. They lost because of the terrorists. They literally capitulated to Zionist terrorists and left the largely unarmed, largely unorganized Arabs that were native to that land to defend themselves against Zionist mobs. History is obviously a lot more complicated than that, but it is true that the British failed, and they were condemned for failing, and they admitted they did, that's why the partition plan developed, because the partition is never meant to be a successful plan. You can look at the partition and tell me if a state would work in those lines. They want it. So yeah, it is very fair to say the British mandate previously was a fucking failure, and the mandates generally are failures, because people in power taking territory do what everyone in power ever always does, especially when they are not accountable to the people living there. Abuse it. So no Tony Blair, don't fucking be there. No one needs more British failure mandate states in this territory. You've already fucking failed. Give self-determination to the peoples. They are a mature, developed, functional peoples. It is infantilizing, it is colonializing, and it is imperial to do this again, and you will only cause more harm.",

Most famously, Henry Kessinger, who helped kill millions and Cambodia and Laos, was heckled almost all of his life, including when he was dead they heckled his mourners. And this was how they honored him in Rolling Stones. In fact, heckling of war criminals has to be some of the best content we've gotten out of politics in the past 10 years, for example. This one, where a guy threw a shoe at George W. Bush for his actions in the Iraq war. Like I said in my previous video, protesting war criminals, even retired ones, has been happening and is still happening. And if you think it is just attacked at Kamala, that is an indictment of you, much more than it is of the people protesting. Because it means you are not paying attention to the protests that are actually happening and have been actually happening. And so I maintain my original point, not a single war criminal should go through their life without being reminded every damn day of their crimes. If they want to get rid of that annoyance, they can turn themselves into the heck. And if you're asking, well, what do you want me to, what do you want her to do? She has no power anymore. She could condemn the genocide. Still hasn't done that. Or better yet, she could turn herself into the heck because she's a criminal. If you're asking, well, she's not doing this anymore, criminals aren't committing crime anymore. Why do we throw them in jail to prevent further ones and to prevent them from doing more?

And I guess you could construct another that is outside of anti-Semitism or white supremacy, but we've yet to see it. And that's because fascism is a Western ideology. And from that Western ideology, the other will almost always be a racialized or ethnic other. It's also gendered and sexual, trans and gay people are otherwise, right?

    "text": "Yes, personal responsibility is right we in propaganda. And a lot of you have fallen for it so much, you don't even realize that it could not exist. For example, there are cultures that don't hold people personally responsible for their actions. They hold their families, or societies, or communities, or friends responsible for their actions and positions. When an elderly person is starving or poor, the culture says that's their family's responsibility, or that is their society or government's responsibility. In America, we expect them to have saved more. That's what personal responsibility is. It's not that we are observation that you could change our you actor, you could change your position. It is the expectation, social punishment, and reward system that we have in our society. In America, it's a super individualist state, so that we have personal responsibility. But there is an alternative, and the fact that you all don't recognize that these alternative exists, and thus choosing between the alternatives is a political choice, is insane. And to be clear, right wingers can be individualistic and they can be communitarian. The right wingers in America are currently going through a transformation from individualism to communitarianism. Individuals are, individualists are incredibly interested in the individual actions that people are taking. Collectivist right wingers hold you collectively responsible, or reward you collectively for the actions of your in groups, and they draw those in groups on race, ethnicity, and nation. White, European, Americans deserve the land because their ancestors built up the country. That's not individual responsibility, and it's certainly not what individualist right wingers believe. And it's also not what communitarian left-wingers believe. Because individualism and communitarianism is a political access. It is a complicated political tool, and if you're simply refused to recognize that it is used politically and engages in complex politics, you don't have even THINGLY the media and political literacy to undermine the amount of right wing propaganda that you engage in on a daily basis.",

This terrorism is the unlawful use of violence against civilians in pursuit of political aims, and America demonetized that we bombed and slaughtered millions of civilians for political aims. We just thought they were good enough, which they weren't, they were lies. So this is my point. People have have interested in the textbook definition of terrorism because the number one terrorist organization in that state would be the United States military. No, no, no. The term terrorist is only used against people engaged in things they label as violence that threaten the political status quo, threaten the current system. When you are a person committing violence against black and brown people in the Middle East, yeah, no, you are a hero. You are a veteran. God, what if you're a white man that shoots up a school, well, then you're mentally ill? Then we just need thoughts and prayers and really need to consider the games we play. But we'll look if you're black people in the black panthers feeding children nasty terrorists that are threatening the fundamental nature of America. If you say you just care about the textbook definition of terrorists, I hope you apply it equally because by that metric, America is a terrorist state. But that's not what the word means and never has been.",

    "text": "Should you use the term anti-Semitic? And is the real anti-Semitism against Arabs? Because they're Semitic? I got this commented by Instagram on the issue and why they don't use the term anti-Semitism anymore. And I think it's an interesting argument, but I do think it can go wrong a lot. First of all, good my answer. You should probably still use the term, namely because the people that are oppressed by it want you to use the term. Second of all, I would appreciate if everyone in the whole world stopped saying the real anti-Semitism was against Arabs because Arabs are Semites. And I'll try and explain why that is my opinion as extensively as I can. First of all, anti-Semitism was a term created to whitewash bigotry against Jewish people. The previous term was Yudin Haas, hatred against Jews. And then with the advent of pseudo-scientific racial science, they attempted to revise that term so that they're hatred and disdain and political violence against Jewish people sounded scientific. And it became anti-Semitism, Semitism being a linguistic group of peoples. But to the racial scientists, it was more than that. It wasn't just a language group right which Arabs are a part of. It was a peoples from a certain place with certain genes and certain characteristics and quite frankly, certain moral worth. And so, well, I guess in some context sociologically and historically, Semite has been used as a legitimate scientific term, the way it relates to anti-Semitism, not legitimate in any way, and the credit, like where that term comes from in science, is completely discredited. So it is an unscientific, flagrantly bigoted origin of a term. And has been almost unilaterally been used to refer to hatred of Jewish people and not of other so-called Semitic races. So put simply, while in some contexts and correctly, I guess, Arabs are Semites because Arabic, as well as Hebrew, is a Semitic language, the Semitic in anti-Semitism has always been used to refer to Jews was a language that was literally causing the death and brutalization and oppression of millions of Jews and thus using it to refer to oppression and brutalization of others because of semantics is, if not actively bigoted, simply wrong. So that's my answer to the first question. Please don't, I think it's gross, I think it's wrong, I think it's bigoted and I think it's harmful. Now to the quest second question, should we use anti-Semitism at all? I think this demonstrates a good reason not to. It was a term used to whitewash it historically. But I think the argument for still using is number one, the oppressed people still want you to use it so you probably listen to them. And number two, the substantive argument is that it has grown a life of its own. We have learned what the particular type of bigotry behind anti-Semitism is under that label. So changing it will make that more difficult and erase some of that education that we've learned. Overall, anti-Semitism is a real problem and a real issue and dismissing it because Arabs are also Semitic is wrong, bigoted and unhelpful. Please stop, if someone has a better or different argument, I'd love to hear it. But simply asserting that there are other Semitic peoples is not good.",

Domestic labor is 50% of the labor in this country. It's fantastic people are saying domestic labor's labor. That's great. Let's have a laboratory model of how it's done. Because the fascists are, they're organizing domestic labor. They know how they want to organize. Do we? And you don't need to know all these answers, but it is important to start thinking about it. Because a lot of Marxists are running off of a playbook from the 1800s. Where the labor that's being talked about is a industrial one. And an industrial one that doesn't really exist in America anymore. We are the center of the empire in the world. When we are thinking about organizing our labor, we need to think across a huge amount of fronts. And you don't need all the answers. I mean, no one does. But if you are advocating, this is the way to do it or this is what needs to be done. Or that is your focus. Make sure your focus is either in what is most important or what you are best at. And it is fantastic if what you are best at is domestic labor. We need people who know how the current economy of domestic labor can be changed. What you want, what that looks like, how to do it. Same goes for prison labor. If you are an ex-con and you have been through it or engaged with it, that is a valid and necessary part of leftist organizing. And so I think a lot of people think about labor organizing. Go, I'm not working in a factory. I can't organize. Or I'm not in even an office job. I can't organize. Yes, you can. You have power, either as a tenant or a debtor or a mother or a prisoner. You have power. And we all need to understand the models of organizing that works to leverage that power. And I can't give all the answers. But for example, a domestic workers who are overwhelmingly mothers, their strike works. If all of them decide that they will not be the one that takes their child into school that day, you know who has to call out? The person labor ring. Now this is as nuanced and complex and interesting to think about as a what we would think of a normal labor strike. But it can also just be as effective. So this is just a general message that if you're out here saying we need to organize labor. Great, we do. Think about all labor and build liberatory models to leverage it. That's the only way we're going to win.",

    "text": "Yeah, fascists don't have to be anti-Semitic. Or at the very least, they don't have to be more anti-Semitic than other conservative ideologies. Because Mussolini, for example, his primary enemy, his named enemy, was not Jewish people. That he just wasn't. And there are accounts of him resisting some of the anti-Semitic policies that Hitler attempted to push. Not to whitewash it. I mean, he was anti-Semitic, but when we're understanding his ideology, it just wasn't the focus as much as it was for Hitler. But why I say that fascists generally are anti-Semitic is because I'm talking in a modern context or like a primary historical context. So most fascists, historically, had largely anti-Semitic tendencies, and almost all fascists today are anti-Semitic in some way, shape or form. And that is because anti-Semitism works incredibly well with the fascist ideology. Fascism's a lot of things to be clear, but when I'm talking about the fascist ideology, at least one way to understand it, is a person that is viewing their nation as a period of national embarrassment. They want to go back to a mythological nation that existed previously. An anti-Semitism, which is based on kind of an ideology that Jewish people are others that invaded, corrupted or poisoned your land, work really well. If you want to point to a group that is not of the mythical homeland, Jewish people, because they are diasporitic, are a great example of this. Once again, that is wrong, that is evil, but that is the connection between the ideologies. But it helps us understand why modern day fascism also might judge and use other minorities. For example, in America, you know who else are diasporitic? Latinos. I don't think they are because I think they have every right to live in America and are American in the same way as every other diasporitic European is. But in our culture and our society, we view a Latino diaspora as coming from South America and Central America. And if you want to leverage white supremacy to justify authoritarian policies, which is what fascists do, to get back to a historical change, you use the population that has massively increased in the recognizable past. So you're right, fascists don't have to be anti-Semitic. Anti-Semitism and its forms, which is the myth of Jewish people being the other, the outsider, the unwelcome in the Poisoner, is very helpful. And when we are trying to counter fascism, understanding anti-Semitism, its history, its caricatures, its dynamics, is incredibly helpful to understanding how anti-Semitism like things are used by fascists today. On other groups, and oftentimes on Jewish people.",

Every single academic that actually researches this pretty much agrees Hitler was a fascist and used socialism as a ploy to appeal to the working class. The number one way you know this is that they are not socialists because they explicitly rejected almost every single piece of Marx and Marxism was their primary enemy. Socialists don't think Marxism is their primary enemy, but this is not worth arguing against. No one who claims this is claiming the facts. So let's just repeat them. Fascism can be defined in incredibly wide amount of ways. But typically, a fascist believes that their nation is an embarrassment and wants to go back to a mythological previous nation. Socialists are people that engage in dialectical materialism and do a scientific analysis of history and view history as a natural development of economic material conditions. To which communism is the end? That's at least one basic understanding of socialism. Those two things are different. One of them wants to go backwards. The other one wants to go forwards. One of them explicitly believes that their nation is above other peoples. Socialists do not. Socialists are either internationalists or national abolitionists. Nothing about what you're saying is true because you're probably a Nazi.",

So the performance of belittling, attacking, and being aggressively mean to poor people struggling financially is itself going to necessarily reinforce the ideas that right-wing ideology is based on, centering self-discipline as the primary moral worth, ignoring, dismissing, or demoralizing systems that exist. Oh, that's just the way it is. Oh, you can't control that. And then demonizing people for their positions in those systems, you are bad and dumb and wrong because you are poor. So I agree that people can be responsible. You can change how you live, and that may help you. But the point is not that. Because first of all, Caleb Hammer is not just helping people financially. He is engaged in an emotional catharsis. There is a reason he loses his mind at guests that he invites on. And second of all, just the very, even if he wasn't emotional, the very creation of that content for performance is going to promote certain ideologies. And for my view, when you do that, I think you can do that, but you must be cognizant and undo that harm. You go, look, I'm trying to help you, but to anyone out there understand that this is not a moral failing, very likely this is a failure of our education system. This is a failure of our economic system. This is a failure of like the cultural and social system were grown up in. But he doesn't do that. He doesn't recognize any of the politics he's engaged in. And when he does, as I pointed out in the previous video, he reinforces the right-wing reactionary content and politics that he supports. So finally, if you're saying, but he's right sometimes, but people can be responsible sometimes, you're missing the point of the critique when I say that he's right-wing propaganda. He's not right-wing propaganda because he's saying right-wing lines. He's not right-wing propaganda because he's telling you to go vote for Trump. He's right-wing propaganda because his very content, done recklessly, done uncritically, promotes the very ideologies that right-wingism is based on.",

Because his whole entire platform is based on finding people that are struggling financially and blaming them for their problems, which in individual cases seems harmless, but consistently showing stories of poor people that are struggling because they refuse to get out of bed, does nothing but promote this fallacy that the reason there is poverty in America is because of individual choices. And not only does he spread this right-wing line, but he also does so in a way that explicitly appeals to right-wing propagandists, LGBT debt. God, I wonder who it's gonna connect those two. So I know that every single episode there is plausible deniability that his goal isn't to blame poor people for their problems, or maybe this individual could do better. But collectively, and his editorial choice to consistently bring them on, is pushing the political line. If all you are shown of stories of poor people are not people that got screwed over by a system, or people that are really trying their best, and just can't make ends meet. But our stories of people that are struggling because of choices they are made, or came from privileged background, which by and large is what Caleb Herrmann is showing. And especially if you are given the emotional outlet that he gives to yell at or demean or diminish these people, there is no way that's not reflected in your politics. And it's intentionally done. For example, the headline I showed is not unique. His headlines have been a misogynistic homovo, big racist, etc. before. And that's not an accident. That's not being me being like, woke. That's what media literacy looks like. Connecting his demeaning or dismissive nature of people who struggle because they are in marginalized identities, because his goal is to spread right-wing propaganda. So please, learn to recognize what this looks like. This media is not a political. And when we talk about building media literary, this is what we mean. Of course, he's not out here repeating Trump talking points. But when you are presented in a media ecosystem that demeans and diminishes certain personalities and identities, like he actively does to poor people and tacitly does to other marginalized groups, there's no way that's not internalized. And then when it's internalized by enough, it's systematized. So we need to fight back on it on every single level. And you can call me woke or overly sensitive or whatever. It doesn't mean that what I'm saying isn't true. And it doesn't mean that the reason that hasn't been called out before is because America has been stripped of almost all of its media literacy.",

And then once Nixon was in power extending the Vietnam War more, costing thousands of Americans and hundreds of thousands of Cambodian lives, and orchestrating one of the largest deforestations and loss of human lives by American hands ever in the Vietnam Loss and Cambodian bombings. He's instrumental in almost every single major American foreign policy failure in that time, and set up the American foreign policy philosophy that still causes up-causing extraordinary destabilization in the Middle East. In his book, he talked about how his goal was to destabilize the Middle East, and he armed and prolonged the Angolan Civil War, which cost thousands of lives. Yet, 0% of the anti-immigrant fervor is against people like him, or Peter Teal, or Elon Musk. Because these people don't actually care about immigrants, fascism is incredibly intersectional, and in order to undermine it, so must we be. So as always, I cannot suggest the Biden-abastered podcast on this un-Nath, they have a great series on Henry Kissinger. Always a good reminder that their whole fervor about immigration is bullshit. It's never one person, it's always the systems that they threaten.",

    "text": "Here's a quick reminder that America labeled Nelson Mandela a terrorist. The British, Gandhi a terrorist. So his Trump attempts to label anyone against fascism, a terrorist, or the Heritage Foundation says that trans people existing is a domestic terrorism threat. Let's remember what that word actually means. Simply means a person that is threatening the current state. Nelson Mandela threatened the apartheid state. Henry Kissinger, on the other hand, his extraordinary violence maintained the state. Luigi Mangioni threatened the system that he was attempting to threaten. And Charlie Kirk's violence maintained it. The line between terrorist and non-terrorist is not violent and non-violent. It is violence the state likes and violence it doesn't. So as the rising fascist regime attempts to massively expand the application of this term, let's remember it is only viable as long as we believe that there is a difference between someone the state considers a terrorist and anyone else. And the most powerful thing we can do is stop giving a fuck. And actually recognize that every time they label someone a terrorist, not only are they deluding the word, but they are pointing us to exactly the people that threaten their power.",

It's like the only place in the Middle East where it's even legal to be gay. So first of all, no, it's not hard to sit with being for Palestinian liberation and Palestinians having policies left from colonizers that are regressive. And second of all, no. No, Israel is not the only place in the Middle East that's legal to be gay. This is a lie they always say. Jordan, perfectly legal to be gay, Turkey, perfectly legal to be gay, Cyprus, also legal to be gay, all in the Middle East. But this is just flagrantly obvious rainbow washing because even if it were true that Palestinians were infinitely horrible to gay people and Israel was perfect to gay people, which neither of those things are true. Nothing about that would justify a genocide. And that's the point. Being a queer for Palestine is being a queer person that doesn't believe in genocide. Nothing about that has to do with whether Palestinians love gay people. Even if they hated them with all of their guts, they don't deserve to be genocide.",

Some of y'all are posting, commenting, or reposting flag-wantly anti-Semitic shit, and I block it on follow y'all, but it is relevant to remind everyone that number one, anti-Semitism matters, and recognizing that isn't de-centering Palestinian liberation, it is actually a necessary fight against the Zionist colonial entity. Because that entity is anti-Semitic, it is maintained by anti-Semitism. Second of all, there are people, either intruders or actual people working for Palestinian liberation who are anti-Semitic or say anti-Semitic shit, either accidentally implicitly or explicitly. Number one, because neo-Nazis are known to invade spaces, but number two, because anti-Semitism is in a bigotry that exists in this world. And just like racism of all other forms, we need to work to deconstruct it to liberate all people. Number three, I'm just fucking tired. I'm tired of having to tell Zionists that anti-Semitism is not anti-Semitism. While seeing some anti-Sionists work on clearly anti-Semitic shit, you can just look bad. And obviously, I'm not responsible for your behavior, and I'm not responsible for my behavior, that's not how this works, but we should be mindful that Zionists will weaponize any and all anti-Semitism in bigotry against the Palestinian liberation. And being principled and effective in actual liberatory politics is the only way to liberate all people. By the way, I know that this will be weaponized by Zionists to think that anti-Semitism is just right with anti-Semitism. It's not. And to be clear, Zionism is an anti-Semitic ideology propagated by anti-Semites. It is not free from this critique and is actually core of it. I can't control how we weaponize, but I can say that if you believe Jewish people run the world or are specifically bad or they're religion is specifically bad or if you ever for some fucking reason hear the term Talmudic, you're probably being anti-Semitic. And you probably are engaged in a disgusting, vile, and harmful type of bigotry that does exist and does cause harm. And dismissing or undermining or denying that is not helping liberation, it's harming it. It is true Israel lies about it. That is true. But the response to that is not to dismiss the existence of it, but actually understand what anti-Semitism is and work as hard as you fucking can against it. Because dismissing, undermining, or god forbid engaging in it is counter-liberatory for everyone and is actually harming any struggle you purport to care about. And on a final and personal note, I just think it's fucking disgusting. I'm not going to text everyone I think is being anti-Semitic, I'm just going to block you. That's all I have to say. Stop being fucking anti-Semitic and let's get actually to work.",

It was never explained to me why they were, and it was never explained to me what their economic or other social policies were. And so I had to learn myself, and I've spent a really long time trying to understand what fascists believe and why, not because I want to be one, but because I want to be armed with the knowledge to recognize one and undermine them. Because it is becoming more and more evident every time I call Trump a fascist, every time I recognize that weight supremacy is on the rise in America. People go, you don't know what those terms mean. And then demonstrate to me that they don't. For example, the primary economic aim of fascist Germany, fascist Italy and fascist Spain was autarky. It was the belief that they should be able to produce anything at home themselves because they knew they were gonna go to war. Does that sound familiar? They're labeled primary enemy. What's Jewish people? But also specifically what they labeled the Jewish ideology of Marxism, and they labeled transgender ideology, homosexuals, and a lot of other indecency as Marxist thought, and that was the banner under which they persecuted them. Does that sound familiar? They demonized racial and ethnic minorities and immigrants, not just because they thought they were inferior, who cares if people are inferior. They thought they were poisoning the other superior people. They thought they were replacing them and making their country weak. Does that sound familiar? And these points are not got your points, right? Autarky is not unique of fascism. It certainly is a policy of fascism, but it was also existent in burgeoning socialist republics because they didn't want to engage in the global society. And they don't work in isolation. But if people were actually taught from a young age what fascism looked like in its totality, why autarky related to bigotry related to anti-immigrant sentiment related to hatred of racial, ethnic, and gender minorities? They would recognize that the reason Trump is a fascist is because every single thing he is doing is in line with that ideology. Not just his battery, not just his hatred of the migrants, not just his foreign policy, but collectively along with the rhetoric, you have to learn what a fascist looks like to be able to recognize them. And then the second you do becomes super clear.",

He and his whole skinhead look are just making it more and more clear if these talking points which have been repeated by Republicans for the past 20 years are white supremacist.

So this should be seen for exactly what it is, which is not helping the Palestinian people, but hiding their clear complicity and war crimes. Because any recognition of a Palestinian state without unrecognizing the Israeli so-called state is not Palestinian liberation, it is liberal propaganda. Not as they should have recognized Palestinian statehood, it's obviously a state and the Palestinians deserve a state. They just deserve all of their land belonging and reparations too, and not a single one of these countries have called for that. Because let's be clear this is not about giving Palestinians what they deserve. It is a PR stunt so that they appear they give a single fuck about Palestinian liberation, while actually setting the tone for the discussion that justifies the continuance of Israel's so-called existence. Because if there are two states, then it's just two states at war, not Israel illegally occupying, oppressing and brutalizing Palestinians, and that it's exactly what these people see it as. They don't see it as a colonial apartheid project doing colonialism apartheid. They see it as a clash between two peoples, and then recognizing it as a state merely justifies war going on, and it's actually paving the way for the continued existence of the colonial apartheid state, alongside maybe another state that they probably think they can control. So while perhaps this is a concession to Israel simply wiping out every single Palestinian, it is not a liberatory end.",

Steven Miller's a white supremacist, and he was caught consistently repeating white supremacist lies when he worked with Breitbart, and that that white supremacist ideology and the great replacement theory that he has promoted is the reason he's doing these brutal and horrendous immigration policies. Right rolling stone? No, I shit you not, they never mention this. They never mention that Steven Miller has been caught red handed as a white supremacist by the SPLC, the Southern Probability Law Center, which is extremely good at finding these people. And I don't even really mean to indict rolling stone on this issue because they're not the worst of it, but we have just so incredibly normalized white supremacy and white nationalism in this country that Steven Miller being caught in see from what he was doing in secret of being a white nationalist isn't even the headline. And to be clear, this came out in 2019 every headline that ever mentioned Steven Miller ever should include this fact because him brutalizing black and brown people is not an accident. It is his whole personality, it's his whole ideology. And it's like good that we're getting attention on Steven Miller. He is an evil, horrible person for a lot of reasons, but those reasons often come back to being a white nationalist. So they're like, what the fuck rolling stone? How would you do what seems to be an attempted expose on Steven Miller without repeating in the video that in 2019 Southern Probability Law Center found hundreds of emails of him being a white supremacist. And that white supremacist, as you mentioned, being basically in charge of Trump's current administration. What?",

His bigotry and despicable actions by saying they should kill him. But let's be clear this discussion was violence before that. Because violence against poor people has been normalized and justified in inherently an American society. And it is a lie. People are not rejecting benefits. Benefits are rejecting them and harming them. And this caused outrage my god as it should. But my god, this is not a start of something bad. This is an end of a very long, decades long. Journey to denigrate and dehumanize. People who just so happen to not have as much money as other people. People that struggle with mental health issues or are of some of the most marginalized classes, especially our disproportionately black and brown or genderqueer. The suggestion on live TV that we should put them to death for simply being poor is no different than advocating we kill them because they are genderqueer or are of a marginalized race. This guy advocated genocide on live TV and all he had to do was apologize a day later and no one saw it. So this is a good reminder that if you think you would have been the one fighting back against fascism in history and you are not actively doing it right now, any excuse you are giving yourself is exactly what they said back then. And then suddenly they found themselves being the group of people who were denigrated and dehumanized on live TV.",

That's right. They want to label any transgender person or just anyone who believes that trans people exist, which is what transgender ideology is, as a designated FBI terrorist organization, and a violent and extremist ideology. And as an unfortunate, I told you so, this is yet another example of terrorism simply being what the state uses to justify its own violence, and literally nothing more. And every single person that allowed for wars or violence or oppression in the name of fighting terrorism set the groundwork for this. Everyone who advocated that we should throw out social issues, because we can just win on economic issues, set the groundwork for this. And now Trump is simply taking up the torch. The characterization of trans people as groomers trying to get into your bathrooms was not accidentally characterizing them as arbitrarily violent. It was very intentionally and always the aim to characterize trans people and all other minorities they can conceivably throw into the grounds as violent, as subversive, as deserving to be erased. So we must learn and remember from the start to end how they demonized, dehumanized, dismissed, and animalized these people, because they will come for you next if they haven't already. And most importantly, we will be facing this state violence. They will come after those people they are now labeling terrorists, just as they have for the past 20 years. It is your choice if you would like to learn from the past and fight against it, or continue allowing them to run what is and isn't violence in this country.",

But the second that's called into question, it falls apart. And the state maintains this very powerful tool of propaganda and state violence with racism, bigotry, otherization and imperialism. They thought they could get away with it with Luigi. Maybe they forgot Italians were white. But I think the public's backlash showed them? No, no, no. We're not going to fall for it this time. And hopefully we have learned not to fall for it again.",

ABC, one, two, three, he's a fascist. If you are anti-Antifa, you are pro-fascist. And at the very least, if you are laboring them a terrorist organization, it means your political ends are challenged by people that are against fascists. But we all know this. We all know Trump's a fascist. He's pretty openly a fascist. And he's pretty openly called for a fascistic things. This is just such peak and incredible irony.",

That's right, the incredible activist that was previously illegally detained by the Trump administration has received a deportation order on what his lawyers called baseless and retaliatory misdemeanor charges. And this is disgusting and obviously unjust and any and all things, including legal routes, should be taken to prevent this. This is a harsh and needed reminder, especially those of us not currently on the chopping block of the American legal system. The American legal system is not our friend. It is not only rife and easily weaponized by fascists, but it was made to be so. So as we lose more and more in the fascistic courts, which we will, we must at some point stop decrying how able the people we are fighting against are and start fighting against them. And just to be clear, this is a call for action of action similar to what Mahmoud did, not an even vague critique of the amazing protester and activist that he was, because his work showed us what fighting against fascists looked like. And currently he is living the consequence of the systems that are meant to protect us from authoritarianism being used by those very authoritarianists.",

    "text": "Aschists should hate your resistance, and they have been known to make their hatred very obvious. For example, there's an organization called Food Not Bombs that just hands out food, and it has consistently been shut down very violently by the cops. That, to me, looks like effective resistance. That looks like something they don't want to be happening. Parades, on the other hand, that have pigs walking side by side with them, seems to be something they are supporting. And you have to ask yourself, why did they see this as something beneficial to them? Tenants unions, strikes by tenants, has been made illegal and shut down by cops. Labor unions used to be illegal, and then they won. When you see an action calling itself anti-fascist, trying to undermine the new American fascist parties, you have to ask yourself, first of all, what is this actually doing to undermine fascism? Is this undermining an economic, social, political aim of fascism? And number two, do fascists hate it? And if number one is not obvious, because to me, parades with signs, it is not self-evident and self-appropriating that they are effective. And number two, if the answer is, no, they don't hate it, maybe think about how to use it to make it something they hate. And I can suggest, or I can use an example without endorsing. Some people go to protests and engage in direct actions against the cops, or some people use protests as cover for other actions to free their comrades. And so I cannot tell anyone how to organize or how to act within their communities. But I can say, a parade that takes the time and energy of a lot of your police force for a day or two could be a good time to do things that the police would not be a fan of. And a parade also tends to be pretty good cover for actions or political actions or engagements that you may need a crowd for. So to this coming week, when we have this new liberals with signs parade that is supposedly anti-fascists, if you're tired, like me, of rolling your eyes at white women who just want to go back to brunch, use them. Do what you can. And think tactically. Because like me, you're probably sick of being annoyed by liberals. It's probably a good time to start using them for the political aims that they can be. And they are damn good cover, they are damn good distraction. And sometimes every so often they can do something helpful.",

They're saying that he was unhoused. He was a white man, so it looks. But I just want to say that when there's this type of violence against us, it's not always racist, but it is always class warfare against all of us. In both of these cases, the Mississippi authorities are finding no foul play, meaning they believe that a young black man hanged himself in the middle of his college campus. And an unhoused man did the same thing two hours apart. Okay, and this violence comes just days after Charlie Kirk, a white supremacist who spews ants, high black rhetoric was killed. And Bill Kilmeade, a Fox News anchor, says. In voluntary lethal injection or something, I just kill him. It's almost as though speaking violence upon people is violence itself for those who were like, Charlie Kirk was just debating people. We see what whiteness does. It upholds violence and it only respects violence. Let's see if any flags go to have massed for these two brothers today. Rest in peace, trade, read, rest in peace, Cory Zucatus.",

Because electing Kamala Harris would have stopped fascism in America for a little bit longer, but she supported fascism, just outside of it. She supported fascism in Israel. We sent billions of dollars under Kamala Harris and Joe Biden to Israeli fascism. And those fascists are exactly the ones that helped train ICE, the now-gastapo of American fascism. But what liberals don't understand is that they can't just keep funding fascism outside of America, which is precisely what liberals have been doing for the past 30, 40 years, without it seeping back in. And Trump's gastapo was literally trained by that seeping of fascism into America. And it certainly doesn't stop fascism, period. It just keeps it of your neighborhood. And that's arguably more dangerous. Because then the citizens of the Metropole being America. Are still incentivized to continue funding, supporting, and tolerate fascist regimes. Because it prolongs their protection and freedom from those various regimes that will come back to them.",

And it looks like they are still figuring out how to make a submission for them that we can't submit to. And so while I have no clue why the original one was taken down, I have a feeling it's because of action similar to what I advocated before, but not like me literally, but like it's kind of obvious. This is a good reminder that they are much more violent than they are intelligent. And so even a little bit of resistance can go a long way to keeping them on their feet. Then being so scared within one day they had to move the website and take down the old one is a win, even if a very, very, very, very small one. Because doxing in an organized systemic level is actually quite difficult. So in the meantime, regarding this new website, I will note, this doesn't seem to have cloud flare protecting it. The second they have their submissions open in any way, I don't know, I just really worry that a bunch of leftist activists might like fill in a bunch of fake forms so that the doxing database doesn't actually work. That I would be really concerned about and I would never want to happen. And I would also certainly never want a DDoS attack from like the 2000s to happen because they don't have DDoS protection. These are all very scary things that you should definitely not do.",

I don't know what else that language does. This is part of the moral and coherence of the right right now. Not only are all of them suddenly for universal human dignity as if half of them didn't sign a missile going into Gaza this past year. But there are also suddenly free speech absolutists and at the same time doxing people using their free speech and canceling them and trying to get rid of their jobs and putting their family and their self in danger. But their free speech absolutist guys and they're also the same people that have called for students to be expelled for the same thing and for the past two years. But that's because they are not principles that they hold. They want to protect their people and they will use any moralism to do so. So don't spend a second caring about them. You can have your own morals, your own views and I think being a humanitarian and being a free speech advocate is generally good. But these people are for the love of God not.",

Do not spare them, put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys. The message of the Bible is not and has never been an entirely pacifist one. And even though God got a little bit nicer in the New Testament, the Old Testament is the same guy. So if you want to virtue signal using Christian ethics to beat down the oppressed people that are celebrating a person that oppressed them, not being here anymore, you're going to need to do a little bit better. Now I'm not a Christian, I don't believe in either of what you said. I have my own morals and I've made my own comments on this. But it is disingenuous to suggest that the Bible is against all political violence. When it explicitly calls for, justifies and explains in pretty large detail the parameters of the political violence of the ancient Israelites. And not only is this nonsense, it's harmful because misinterpreting the Bible to represent it as a book of peace clearly is what promotes these myths about other religions as religions of violence. It leads and promotes bigotry. It's disingenuous and it's not what you actually believe. Christians honestly reading the Bible do not believe in no political violence. So me as an agnostic or as an atheist actually has the moral flexibility to talk about when political violence is relevant or not relevant, but you don't. Your book justifies and allows for political violence, so I don't really fucking want to hear it.",

No one's going to win a lawsuit in the name of Charlie Kirk for anyone even flagrantly lying about him, which Stephen King wasn't. Stephen King said something that was true about him. So not only would it be a failing libel or slander or defamation case in the first place, it would fail because he's dead and dead people don't have a reputation. We know this because OJ Simpson's the state tried to shut down defamation of him, and they failed because dead people don't have a right to defamation. This is stupid. Stop trying to silence speech.

Now all this is tricky and difficult, and all of the scenes we are seeing are absolutely despicable. What is important to remember is that any and all calls for gun control must be matched with incredibly powerful calls for arming and training minorities, because if anyone needs self-defense from a system that is violent towards them, it is the minorities that are consistently stripped of that right to self-defense. So I agree gun regulation is necessary, but in America there is no chance in hell that that gun regulation is done in a way that actually protects the people that need to be protected.

America has rejoiced in the murder of thousands. The only difference is either you think one is justified, or you dehumanize the victims of the one you celebrate. Citizens in the Middle East are worth politically murdering for the war on terror, but a single fascist being killed in America warrants a whole discussion about whether political violence can ever be justified. So if you want to say you are only doing this on a human level, regardless of politics or actions or impact or violence, where are you mourning Sinwar? Where are you mourning the Yemeni Prime Minister that was killed? Or has that been so normalized, it's actually offensive to even humanize them? Because that seems to be the state. We can humanize, respect, and actually get attacked for failing to respect a white supremacist and fascist. But the second it is a leader of a Middle Eastern country that is politically at odds with America or Israel, they are fair game, they are not fathers, they are not family men, they are not people, and it is actually shameful to mourn or show any amount of empathy towards them. And so while as a matter of personal practice, I am a humanist and attempt to have empathy for all people, including the most despicable, you aren't. The vast majority of people that are attempting to say this will never and actively justify never, showing empathy towards the vast majority of victims of actual political violence. Being against political violence means mourning the people we throw in jail for the most heinous crimes, seeing the harm that is done and understanding in the cases that it is necessary. But that's not the discussion being had. The discussion being had by the vast majority of people is they see someone they identify with more than the vast majority of victims of political violence.",

Airplan has always been to get as many wealthy, well-connected and successful people into these illegal places so that it is justified. Oh, we brought civilization, we brought technology, we bought Harvard grads like Zack over here, and of course they can't be colonizers, they can't be brutalizing people, they can't be engaged in genocide, but they are. So Zack, my friend, birthright is not just another camp that you can enjoy and make friends and maybe get a girl or boyfriend. It is a part of a colonial project used to justify brutalization, colonialism, and genocide of the people who's land you're standing on. Leave, and why the fuck would you show your face on this?",

That's right, Palantir, the company that's currently selling facial recognition software to help ice, brutalize, and kidnap immigrants, is an immigrant himself. He was first born in Germany and then he moved to apartheid South Africa occupied Namibia. I don't want to hear about illegal immigration from him. And he's gone on to be one of the most evil men in America, if not only because he is the reason we are tormented with JD Vance's face every day, having funded his sanitorial campaign, but also his company Palantir literally helps Israel slaughter Palestinian children. Other great highlights from Peter Teo are allegedly being really interested in youth's blood. His former lover mysteriously having died and being outed by Gauker and then suing them to bankruptcy. Peter Teo is every right-winger's worst nightmare, a day immigrant coming to ruin America, but he's doing it with neo-Nazi movements and incredibly evil technology, not taking jobs and God forbid, paying taxes like all the other immigrants are doing. So the next time a right-winger asks you about illegal immigration or immigration harming America, tell them hell yes, let's support Elon Musk and Peter Teo. And if they don't want that, they don't want what's best for America.",

A Israeli propaganda show and they brought on two professional Israeli propagandists. This is April Powers, the one you saw speaking, and she works for Project Shema, which literally supports and spreads the definition of anti-Semitism that includes critiquing Israel. According to her, saying that Israel's committing genocide is anti-Semitic, and her whole job is indoctrinating new people to believe that. And the other guy is Nate Looney, a fitting name for a person that works at a Zionist organization that receives funds and sends them to Israel to continue its genocide. They literally raised over $100 million to send to support the Israel disaster, which is what they called the current state of Israel during its genocide, because Israelis are the ones that are suffering guys. And yet all they wanted to talk about here, not their work supporting genocide, not their connections to Israel, not them actively supporting a state, literally slaughtering people because of their ethnicity. No, no, no. They wanted to talk about their religion and ethnicity. And so I'm so so sorry, but DEI doesn't count in a colonial state. There is no equity in apartheid. There is no diversity in apartheid genocidal state, and there is certainly not inclusion. You can say that that's what you want in your jobs and in your federation, and if you get your paycheck fucking go you, but you will never be for diversity, equity, and inclusion as long as you are defending a apartheid genocidal state.",

Because this is fucking irresponsible. This is not about Hamas. Israel has met with Hamas in Qatar. Qatar is a peaceful, meeting territory for negotiations. If Israel wants to even continue to pretend with the pretense of winning the hostages out, they cannot bomb the place that is hosting negotiations. For this opinion on negotiations, it is a sovereign territory. They can host to member they'd like. And Israel cannot illegally bomb them. America has hosted terrorists in its place. We had members of the PLO in America. Does that give Israel the right to bomb them? Of course not. Israel is an illegal, aggressor state that is actively, openly, and clearly attempting to destabilize the Middle East for its own benefit. They are not interested in peace. They are not interested in even winning the war. Israel's fascist government and the regime itself, requires that they are consistently attacked to justify their brutalization, colonialism, and displacement of Palestinians. And if they ever did see peace, the system of brutalization that their very state is founded upon would fall apart.",

Your anger should uniquely be leveraged towards the people that are starving people in our society, which are the people that don't pay people enough. The policymakers maintain the system of oppression and extraction that forces people who tend to work full time to not be able to feed them and their children and every motherfucker advocating a maintenance of that policy. But no, you spend your time in these little comments putting litmus tests on who dare get the privilege of waiting in line for an hour and a half to get a random assortment of food to feed their children. Because high income people always just have an hour and a half of random time that they would love to use waiting in their car to get a certain amount of food that they have no clue about. That's what I know my high income friends to do. Yeah, because so many people are taking advantage of the system and even if they were fucking who cares, you go wait in an hour and get food, you fucking earned it. Anyway, I'm just generally angry, fuck the people in the comments. They're such assholes and thank you so much for doing the work that you do. This is awesome. Everyone, if you can, if you need to, if you want to, go use your local resources, food banks, libraries, everything that you are provided and you can use, you should use. Buy and learn because they get their funding based on how many people use them. So if you don't use it, you will lose it.

While here, illegal and despicable this act is very important, the focus should be on why is Willis doing this, because they are so intent on committing genocide, starving, and brutalizing Palestinians that they are willing to commit an extraordinarily illegal act seemingly into Tunisian waters to prevent even that amount of aid from getting in. And this should be understood as what it is, which is a part of an extraordinarily long pattern of Israel being an openly criminal state. We do not just want justice for the Flotilla members, even though we certainly do. We want justice for every single person that has died, will die, or has been brutalized, starved, or attacked or displaced by this criminal regime. And that justice will only be reached when the colonialism, imperialism, and displacement caused by the Zionist regime ends with the end of the Zionist regime.",

The Grinit Thunberg being in that active war zone is probably a very stupid... ...she wasn't an active war zone. She was in Tunisia, not at war with Israel. They bombed a civilian ship in the territorial waters of a country they are not at war with. What are you talking about? Very stupid thing and she should expect to be attacked for it. Especially considering the fact that the state of Israel is currently a war with terrorist organization and yes, how much... But not at war with Tunisia and by the way Greta didn't get bombed. The whole flotilla isn't Greta, you're obsessed with her. Yeah, just to be clear, they got bombed seemingly in territorial waters of Tunisia, not outside of Gaza, not even in the territorial waters of what would be Gaza, which are also militarily occupied, not in a war zone, in a civilian territorial water. It is obviously illegal and there is no justification of self-defense for it because they weren't in the war. For context of this video, he is kind of maybe like saying it's justified in the whole video if you want to watch that rot, just to be fair to that given fascist. What he's saying is, well, this justification does make sense and I completely agree with the right wing that she could have deserved to be bombed. But maybe don't because there's just celebrities, that was his point. Still evil and still validating the exact point that I want to undermine here. They weren't in a war zone. There's no self-defense justification in any reality.",

And this isn't just abstract and ideological. The literal same weapons that ICE are using were used and developed by the IDF against Palestinians and the same techniques to undermine them, like how to avoid tear gas were developed across the empire between Palestine and Malaysia. The organizing structures, the communication networks, the function of movements were developed by oppressed peoples who were oppressed by America and its empire outside of America. And we need to learn from them as the American Empire turns inward and oppresses its own people. It may seem hopeless and you know, sometimes I even worry that it is. But we have techniques, movements and models to learn from on how to fight and not give up because they will win their laboratory struggles and some of them have. And so will we.",

And in that case, you're 100% correct, primarily extreme bigotry and vitriol. Because what's that flag behind you? Not the Jewish flag. That's the Israeli flag, babe. In this video, you consistently compare the quote-unquote oppression of Hindus in India by Muslims to the quote-unquote oppression of Israeli Jewish people in Israel by Muslims. And the point of this video is not to repeat that nationalism is wrong. This is stupid. It's obvious that by and large, the oppressors in India who are in power are the Hindustani nationalists. And the oppressors in Israel are by and large the Jewish supremacist nationalists. What is important here is the fascists that want to promote fascistic narratives, such as the idea that Muslims are the eternal, consistent, and unique oppressor are finding their allies. Israel is finding its allies in Christian evangelicals that want to establish a Christian ethno state in America. They're finding their allies wherever they can. And one of those allies, which is actually kind of surprising from an American perspective that is hyper-race-focused, is the Indian nationalists who are super fucking racist. Hindustani nationalists are just as vitriolically nationalists and bigotent and fascistic as his rally nationalists are. And fascism, as much as they would like to convince you otherwise, is actually extraordinarily global. It's extraordinarily intersectional. They are happy to accept the other as long as it promotes their particular political brand. And the aims of German and Italian and French and Israeli and Indian nationalists are pretty similar. They have a pretty similar worldview, even though their worldview is based on the superiority of their own individual nation. And so as we undermine fascism, we also have to understand it, not as something unique to our nation. And as we undermine Christian nationalism in America, we have to understand that it is built on the exact same building blocks as German nationalism was, Italian nationalism was, Israeli nationalism was, and Hindustani nationalism is. And that better understands how they work together to oppress and undermine and attack, because damn right do they work together? The oppressors of Modi and Nenyaahu work damn well together. But we also can use it to build better libertary politics. The fascists know who their allies are, to we. Because in my view, our allies are everyone that is oppressed by every form of this nationalism, of this hyper nationalism, of this ethno nationalism. And that means that there are shit ton more of us than there are of them.",

We can have debates about whether the crumble's cookie guy deserved to be outed politically, but Peter Teal certainly did, and from my perspective at least, anyone that uses their privilege as a straight presenting person to do incredible harm against the society that they get that privilege from should have it taken away. Especially if you use that privilege to build systems of oppression that hurt LGBTQA plus people. We should use any and all tools that we have to take down your power.

Today Israel is claiming to be a strong soldier in the fight against religious radicalism by attacking Palestinians who are seen to be religious radicals all of them, while promoting religiously radical politics in every aspect of their politics and society. Of course, it's not okay to destroy a civilization that is seen as uncivilized regardless. Every part of that intuition must be rejected, but a helpful fact about it is that it internally, even if accepted, is obviously untrue. A civilized society doesn't slaughter thousands of people. A civilized society doesn't kill the most journalists of any war within the past ten years. A civilized society does not allow children to starve, but a society that relies on the delusion of civilization, well they, they can steal 80% of the West Bank within the past month in the name of bringing settlements to it. They can have votes on how many Palestinians to slaughter. But that doesn't count for anything, and we certainly shouldn't let it count for anything.",

We all know that Elon Musk's father made a shitton of money on the ever-rubbed in apartheid South Africa, effectively enslaving the Native Africans. But Peter deal's father somehow found a more evil way to make money because he ran a uranium mine in occupied Namibia. And they didn't tell the people working there what they were mining. So a huge portion of the workers, if not all of them, got radiation poisoning. And for those of you who don't know, South Africa wasn't only bad because of its domestic policy of extraordinary apartheid from which the name comes, but they also illegally occupied their trusteeship of Namibia, which is right next to South Africa, and the UN ordered that it was clearly illegal, and they flagrantly ignored them for a long time. And so in that occupied territory, while it was occupied, paying taxes and in collaboration with the illegal occupier of South Africa, Peter deal's father ran a literal mine poisoning its workers. And I tell you this story, not just a slander Peter deal, but because it is important to recognize that this evil literal Nazi shitt is not coming out of nowhere. There have always been these evil people he was raised to be as racist and elitist as you can mildly conceive, and he continued to be. There is so much to this universe.

All will bring their corporate sponsors and their corporate accomplices right into the loop. Because it's one thing to have your wife or your husband or your former summer lover in Israel and have happy memories with it. It's another thing entirely to have your whole entire livelihood or origin connected to it. Your resume always have to have Tel Aviv audit. You can ever hide that one. I don't know if this is new, if you know someone tell me, but this is such a smart move by the Israeli propaganda ministry. You have to give it to them. It's absolutely despicable and it hammers home the point that Deloitte, McKenzie, and all of the big four as well as most major corporations in the West are entirely complicit, especially with this particular colonial project. But it is just stark and incredible to see the government literally committing genocide in Palestinians to be not only hiring, not only working with Deloitte and one of the largest American firms in the world. But also literally partnering with them directly to justify and normalize and connect new people and new settlers to their colony with the economy of the West. It is disgusting, but it's not very surprising. And it's actually a really good move on their part. And when we say that fascists are intersectional, this is what we mean.

Which is that Israel is illegally and harmful and genocidally starving Palestinians for the past two years. We cannot become desensitized as Israel continues to normalize their illegal blockade of aid, such that civilians have to resort to the very last thing which is going there themselves. This is not normal. This is not how it is meant to go and this is not acceptable. What Israel is and has been doing is clearly and obviously criminal and they must be held to justice. And in the meantime, we must continue to demand every single piece of power, every single state, every single person acting anywhere internationally to put as much pressure on Israel to prevent this and put as much pressure on every state to do everything they can do to prevent this. Because it is a shame that civilians have to do this. Americans should be militarily intervening in this colonial project. Every state that claims to stand in solidarity of the Palestinians should be but they are scared. So I keep the flow till in my mind but I keep more Palestinians in my mind.

Even if this would sway some voters, why the fuck does a fascist care that much about voters? He's trying to undermine our electoral democracy. This is important. We owe it to the victims. We owe it to everyone who believes in democratic accountability in America. But in terms of political efficacy, the files just won't do that much on a real analysis. And so our energy should be put towards what can actually undermine fascism, which is not shifting the dial one or two percent on electoralism, or shaming, shaming, shaming the fascist dictator, but undermining those keys of power that he is writing on. Organizing the workers of the empire so that you can actually undermine the powers of the empire. And engaging in direct action and alternative power creation, such that the empire that he is taking over, the state apparatus, the economy that he is integrating into the state is owned by the workers, owned by the people that actually live in it, and anyone that disagrees with the incredible power consolidation he's doing, not just shaming, shaming, shaming drop. Everyone in this country could hate him except for the top 1% of oligarchs, and he would still be in power. We just don't need workers that hate him. We need workers that are organized, such that they can stop him.",

    "text": "The word DOD should incite just as much anger as IDF. If someone is a veteran, they should be viewed in the same light as a settler. I'm so happy us as a generation are actually turning around on Israel. Our generation genuinely supports Palestinians and their struggle more than Israelis. But if we do not understand that this is a global effort against American and Western imperialism, we will lose the momentum that we have built up against Palestine. The American Department of Defense is our imperial arm. Every person that fights for it is part of that empire. And so if you met someone and you wouldn't be friends with them because they served in the IDF, I want you to consider how you should treat your uncle who's a veteran at Thanksgiving. Because they are committing just as many war crimes and at the very least, they are aiding and abetting it. But we probably have compassion for them. We probably know that they wanted to go on to college without it. We probably know that they were too poor or brought into it by a family not to. And that's true of many IDF agents as well. But we still give the same reaction. So we should have the same bar. And my personal bar is that you have to be an apologetic and actively undermining activist of American empire from me to respect that. You have to go, yeah, I committed war crimes. I will never be able to atone for that enough. But here's the work I'm doing. And then that's between you and God. But if you are still saying I deserve respect as a American veteran, know the fuck you don't. So please remember that as you go home for Thanksgiving, as you talk to your family, as you talk to your friends that went into the military. They don't deserve your respect just as much as an IDF member it doesn't.",

Why in the world before a candidate who is objectively evil, even starts running, announces their candidacy, or even vaguely starts winning the primaries, would you say, yeah, if he wins, all vote for him. What? What? Even if that is how you feel, shut the fuck up and say, no, I will not campaign. I have voted for 20, 30 years for Democrats, and I hate this man. And if you do him, you will lose my support. And then switch up. Because if we are talking about political efficacy, we are not talking about moralism, we're not talking about what's right or wrong, we're saying what's politically efficacious, what you need to be fighting for right now is the most anti-fascist person that could get that ticket of Democrats. And it is objectively very clearly not Gavin Newsom. And this is what liberals don't understand about the whole political efficacy talk. If you want leftists to lie and say, oh yeah, we love Democrats, oh yeah, Kamala wasn't a war criminal. You need to be in the same vote as well. You need to change your politics as well. And that includes not just folding the fuck over when a white man has a good social media team doing tweets and all caps. It's not good politics, and it's not politically efficacious. If Gavin Newsom wins, we will just have a different face of fascism. Or we will have not quite fascism, but neoliberalism that kills right about as many people. So if you want to end the horrors of fascism and not just the current iteration of it, you'll need to get a fucking political backbone. And part of that is being willing to change it up and say, no, I will leave, no why we use my power. And then you know, you can do the analysis, harm reduction, whatever at the time. And I don't support lying necessarily, but you get my point. Don't fold at the least possible conceivable pressure because it's embarrassing. And it also shows your hand. You don't want to be politically effective. You just disagree with leftists.",

And God, I wonder why the American education system didn't teach that the Nazis also hated communists, or that the communists were the ones that murdered the most Nazis. But that said, it is extremely dangerous how we are to taught fascism of the past because it nuders our ability to have respond to it now. If we are taught about it as isolated and singularly racial, then we are unable to see how their racism, their anti-semitism, their bigotry was entirely tied to their economic and social ideology. And that nuders our ability to see how that same shit is happening today. If we don't see how they use Jews as a scapegoat to attack communists who are threatening their economic interests, then we fail, for example, not the same, but similar and what we can learn from to see how we are using immigrants as a scapegoat to attack socialists and leftists and pretty much any organization like pro-Palestinian organizers who challenge the current status quo. And how those immigrants are very much code for just certain racial groups that they don't like. This racialization of a person for political aims was erased from our history of past fascist movements, but is fundamental to current fascist movements.",

    "text": "Do people just not know about crisis pregnancy centers? Ooh, I do. I watched your whole video and I respect how respectful you are, but crisis pregnancy centers are fucking evil. To start, imagine a crisis pregnancy center as a pro-life version of Planned Parenthood. Now imagine that they have consistently been caught lying about providing abortion services. And receive over a billion dollars from states every single year to spread pro-life propaganda, guilt trip pregnant women into not having an abortion, and lie about the resources and services that they provide. Then in your mind, you have something kind of close to a crisis pregnancy center, but take away the actually qualified medical professionals, because the vast majority of these are wildly underqualified to what they say they offer. Because unlike actually licensed medical professionals, their goal is not just to serve the patient in front of them as best they can. Their goal is to promote explicitly the political agenda of working for the pro-life cause. And I'm not against things being political. I'm very political. Planned Parenthood is very political. But I am against explicitly lying to women as part of that political campaign, and simply lying about what you do, because they don't support the child throughout its life. They support maybe a child until like a few years, maybe one year after life, and then barely support the woman during pregnancy, because their goal is to appear like they are helping people so they can justify oppressing those people. That is what a crisis pregnancy center does. They've been caught deceiving women. They've actively harmed women, by the way. Deception and delay on abortion makes abortion worse for women. And they are explicitly and almost uniquely used as political tools to justify taking away the choice from women wanting an abortion, or not wanting an abortion, and putting the government in its place. No matter how many diapers you conservative, who actively take diapers on women's hands when you cut things like snap, or other welfare programs, etc. No matter how many diapers you donate, it will not justify telling the women what to do, rather than allowing them to make that fucking choice for them, and crisis pregnancy centers, both politically and in fact in effect, take that choice away from women. It's disgusting. I understand how you could have been tricked by it, but hopefully. This helps. You learn why it's horrible.",

And it's important to remember, this is not the first time in American history that we've had to do this. Strikes used to be illegal. The National Labor Relations Board is a compromise and a bad one at that. Food distribution has been made illegal in almost every single major city. And San Francisco has called in the National Guard to undermine food not bombs food distribution before. We know an advocacy has been made illegal and damn near every time you've heard agitators engaging with the cops, that is just illegal self-defense. We as people, as the laws become more and more and more immoral, which they already wear, need to become a lot more comfortable with doing what we do even if it becomes illegal. And if we don't, all they need to do is what they're already doing, telling us what the laws are and corrupting the systems that would correct that. And they can win that game. We can win the game of organizing and building effective self-defense. Because they have the people, we have the institutions, and we can't give a single ounce of fucking credit to the institutions that are being corrupted and taken over by fascists.

I think right-wingers have been preparing for years to undermine and attack Venezuela, and Trump just has the balls to do it. Because they have extraordinary natural resources, that America want. And we have interfered with their elections and their democracy and their government hundreds of times. We've just been mostly unsuccessful, but you only need one. It's not because we're bothered by a bad socialist government. Thousands of people are starving every day. Our tax dollars are going to slaughter hundreds of thousands. We don't care about people that would be struggling in Venezuela. It is because Venezuela has resources, a shit ton of oil, and natural gas, that we want. So don't let them, for two seconds, convince you this is about anything more than America imperializing this territory. It's not about protecting America. The vast majority of drugs that kill Americans come from America. And the vast majority of people that become drug addicts, who are the people we're protecting right now, quick reminder, become addicted because of medicated drugs that are super profitable.

We certainly don't need to organize the labor force, working with prisoners, what? Actually asking immigrants what would free them from the fascistic rule they're under right now? Pshh, get this grandma a sign and eliminate Stan, she can support, and that'll stop the fascists. That's a joke. No kings day, you can go. It should be fun. I enjoy being in the park too. But this is not what we need right now. We need mass mobilization events that don't work with the fascist cops that are brutalizing and destroying our neighbors and communities. We need mass mobilization events centered around building community that can actually defend against fascists. That means working with labor unions, tenants unions, debtors unions, mutual aid organizations, the same mutual aid organizations that those cops that you're organizing with are breaking down. This is at best a pretty fun day and you could meet some cool community members and at worst normalization and actively putting oppressed people at further risk by mobilizing the cops. So if you want to help, if you want to come to this protest, come and then go join a mutual aid organization after. And then go talk to leftist and ask about their doing because leftists have always been the ones that undermine fascists. Libros have always been the ones that opened the door for them.",

And this will inevitably be leveraged to justify some form of sanction, attack, or direct invasion, probably through one of our allies, of the now quite effective anti-imperial block that that leader is building up in the Sahel. And that action of Americans caring about it, of Americans justifying their own intervention by it, which we have done thousands of times at this point. Does not help gay people either. The best thing we can do for civil and fundamental human rights is to end Western intervention, end Western imperialism, and allow self-determination. Because guess what? People get more bigoted, the more you bomb them, and people get more progressive, the less you do it. And that region has been under effective French economic and military occupation for the past 100 years. So give them some time and progress will happen.

This has always been racist. American immigration policy, even back to its first immigration policy, the Chinese Exclusion Act, is and always has been really fucking racist. And I trust you genuinely don't think it's racist, but let's break down the actual argument, because there is no way to be a nativist, which is what you have to be to be anti-immigration, and not in America at least some form of racist. Because the native ass argument goes, this is like the nice Charlie Kirk argument that's been set out thousands of times, is if you allow a huge amount of immigrants in, it undermines the culture and society that we have built in America. The issue with that is that the culture you're thinking of doesn't actually exist. America doesn't have a cohesive culture. It has multiple different cultures, and it has a huge amount of racial, ethnic, and cultural diversity. And so in order to say we need to protect that, you need to be picking one out. And I've never seen these people say these new Latino immigrants are threatening the Latino culture within America. No, obviously what they are talking about is the perceived white and colonizer culture that is built up in America. And then in order to say it needs to be protected from other cultures, you must believe that it is better and worthy of being protected from other cultures. So therefore you must believe that the generally white Caucasian like Euro culture that is built up in America is better. Do you see the white supremac... or the equations coming together for your centrist? So no, there's no moderate position here. You can't believe that your culture is being threatened by other people and not be racist in America. You can believe immigration is affecting economic or social issues in America. You'd be wrong, you can believe that, but you'd be wrong, and you know this because you spend every day talking about this issue. So either you are stupid and wrong and think that it's harming our economy when let's say it's the backbone of our economy. Or as I know you to be, you are a cultural argumentator for immigration. And you think that it is threatening what America has built up or they don't share our culture. And then you just must leave our culture a superior and there is no way to do that in America without being flagrantly racist. So welcome to the discussion buddy. Own that you are a white supremacist or stop being one.",

But they literally not once have recognized that the devastation Israel's cost is the equivalent of 20 million Americans dying as a proportion of population. And that's because their goal isn't to humanize humans, isn't to relate Americans to people that are not American. It is to relate Americans to Israelis. It is to get us to identify with the people who suffered because of the backlash of their oppression, and not because of the people who suffered because of the oppressive colonial state itself. And this has always been the playbook of Israel. Whenever the Palestinians fought back, justifiably unjustifiably, morally or immorally, Israel will beg the West to identify with them, and not the thousands of Palestinians that they have oppressed, brutalized, and murdered. This is yet another way to humanize Israel's which I don't doubt we should humanize every human. But in correlate, dehumanize Palestinians. That is despicable.",

One of the best ways to know which side of the truth is on is to know which side is advocating that independent unbiased journalists are allowed into the area that needs to be investigated. Hamas even has called for the allowance of independent journalists into Gaza. Israel, on the other hand, has actively murdered those independent journalists, made them illegal and expelled them from even Israel proper. If there is nothing too hide, let the journalists in. We figured it out in Afghanistan, we figured it out in Iraq, we could figure it out in Gaza. And they always say it's for protecting the journalists, which is nonsense, because they are the ones killing the journalists. Every single journalistic organization says number one, it is perfectly possible to have journalists reporting from this territory. And number two, the biggest threat to every journalist that has entered and gone there is Israeli bombs. We'll say again, Israel, if you think everything is Hamas or Iran propaganda, let in journalists. In tell then, the propaganda that you let in are not going to be believed.",

    "text": "This sign is thinks that the boycott divestment in sanctions list actually is getting Palestinians further away from a state. Let's see why. If the BDS movement were really about human rights, its supporters would be protesting the breakdown of human rights in countries across the Middle East. Okay, that has nothing to do with whether it's going to free Palestine. But also, we are. The same people that are protesting against Israel were protesting against America's illegal invasion into Iraq. You know who was helping that illegal invasion into Iraq which destroyed human rights? Israel. And while we're at it, would you say the same thing about the BDS movement against South Africa? Would you say that they can't have conceivably been genuine because they were only boycotting South Africa? No, of course not because in hindsight everyone realizes that this shit works. That's why Palestinians are asking us to do it. Okay, let's keep watching. This is because it misrepresent the conflict as a zero-sum game, but the conflict is not a zero-sum game. Watch this video. I promise you this is the actual only argument they make in relation to why the BDS movement is bad. But it's also stupid. There is a zero-sum game. Either Israel continues its genocide once wipe out all the Palestinians and Sikhs seeds or it doesn't. That's how Smotrige sees it. That's how Ben Givir sees it. That's how Netanyahu sees it. That's how Ben Givir saw it. And he was correct. The Israeli-genocide will state requires genocide to continue. It either wins or it loses. Israel as it currently exists either continues to exist or it does not. And the BDS movement is on the correct side of saying it should not. Now if you want to say it's not a zero-sum game because something called Israel could continue to exist. Fine. But what the BDS movement is boycotting and divesting from and sanctioning is the genocidal ethno state. And that is a zero-sum game. It should not exist as a genocidal ethno state. And also you haven't told me why it's a zero-sum game. The Palestinians either continue to live or don't. It's pretty obvious. You end this by saying you need to care equally about Palestinian safety and security as you do Israeli safety and security. And that's just not true. Did we need to care about white people's safety and security in South Africa? White supremacists in Rhodesia safety and security? No. No. Because they were the ones in power. The BDS movement is the people using global power to fight against the people in power in Israel upusing it. So we're going to care about the people who are being oppressed because the people in power care about themselves and are using their own power to protect them. This video is hilarious because it makes a wild claim that the BDS movement which is the Palestinian primary aim and ask of the world is undermining their goals. Even though it worked in South Africa, it's worked across the world. It is one of the few highly effective activist structures. But the Palestinians don't know how to liberate themselves. Zionists do.",

Almost every genocide heir, every country that has wanted to genocide in other peoples, have tried to characterize those peoples' men as uniquely militant or vicious or aggressive or animalistic. The Germans did it, the Serbians did it, the Israelis are doing it. And by the way, they tend to characterize their women as particularly victims and helpless ones at that. Not only are these narratives obviously sexist, but they are consistently repeated, and it is important that we learn them and learn why they are beneficial to the cause. Because then, women are seen as, well, helpless victims that just happen to be in the way, and men are justified, substantive targets, and children are just caught in the crossfire. And before you know it, every single individual has a justification for being slaughtered. And it is infuriating to see this history repeat itself. They are not creative, nor do we have to be.",

Start with the why definition, which is a sex worker is someone who exchanges sexual services, performances, or products for material composition, which includes what you think of classically as sex work, but also clearly includes sexual materials. Certainly includes things like pornography, loot, writing, or art, where even sexualized other content, which was my point, if I take off my shirt and no people will find it hot or even do sexual acts to it, does that make me a sex worker? What if I get paid because of that? What if I take out my feet? The dangerous part here is a lot of the commentary from leftists that I received when I said I support sex workers was negative. They demonized, attacked, undermined, or was directly offended by that support. But if almost any worker on some way, a sex worker can be labeled a sex worker, and I think rightly so, because as the quote goes, everything in this world is about sex, except sex, which is about power. And then being labeled a sex worker gets the attack and expulsion from the leftist support and movement. We are giving an incredibly powerful tool to the people working against leftists, and that is fucking dangerous. Not even to mention that most of the sex workers spoken to, number one, agree with what I'm saying. Number two are based as hell. And number three are very politically educated and know how to liberate themselves. The amount of chauvinism, infantilization, and just clear, like misogyny, I have seen from leftists talking about this issue is incredible.",

Because if your only argument for us tolerating Y'all's evil shit is winning, you're not doing that good of a job at it. And every time we have a vaguely leftist or progressive candidate, the Democratic Party goes out of its way to remove their support from it. Not even talking about mom Donnie, they do this all the time. The Democratic establishment rolled over when A-PAC funded Rashida to leave out of her seat, rolled over when A-PAC tried to corrupt our elections against Ilhan Omar. So Democrats, if you're only argument to leftist to a right now saying, Hey, Gavin Newsom or insert other basic evil liberal that is running for candidacy like in the next three years is bad, if you're only argument to that is, Well, why don't you do something with power? We've tried, y'all actively work against us and by the way, you're not that good at power. As a final point, there's this strange arrangement that happens when I'm talking as a leftist to liberals about this issue because they cause play as leftist, they say, Well, you know, I would really love that but it just won't win. Well, we need all the allies we can get. Motherfuckers, you're the one not going far enough. But the fuckers, you don't agree with me. You don't want a socialist future, you don't want a communist future. You want a liberal, a neoliberal, a market, a capitalist future. And so it's not us disagreeing about how to get there. It's us disagreeing about what we want and you are working and using your power and your context and your political and social position to get what you want, which is the maintenance of the liberal position. I am using what I can and part of that is critiquing, attacking and undermining political candidates who by the way aren't even running yet because they work actively against my aims. And so I'm going to push all institutions including the democratic institutions closer to the politics I want. Do we understand that? So please, stop pretending it's about political efficacy. You are not politically efficacious and stop pretending that you're a leftist and just know better. You don't.",

This nuance is lost when the people with money and capital keep putting every single focus of every single policy or organizing or politics or anti-fascist action at voting because the first thing the fascists do is undermine your ability to make any change with voting. They might let you vote but they're corrupt the elections. They'll overthrow any actual dissidents that would challenge them in elections. They will use every strategy necessary to undermine your power. So you have to use every strategy necessary to maintain your power.

But it seems like the most important question in politics and it's almost never directly addressed. And I guess my first question is why is it never directly addressed? I think it is because if it were to be directly addressed, the answer is obvious. There are two engagements with reality here. The left-winger says it is because society is forcing to be. They've stolen from them in their wage labor or it's beneficial to them to have a proletariat to hire for the factories when people go on strike. I tend to agree with that reality, but even if we take the right-winger view, which is some people are just too lazy or dumb to work or to earn enough money to not be poor, I have to ask, is that a good reason to let them be? Is then being lazy or dumb a good reason to allow people in our society to starve on the street? When I was a baby, did they look at me and go, how smart will this baby be? How smart or hardworking will this baby be? Does he deserve to continue living? Because if you don't think they should have done that, which I hope you don't, surely we shouldn't allow people who are too dumb or too lazy to work, which I don't think it exists. I don't think those humans exist. I've never met one. But even if we accept they did, I don't see why I would let them starve. And that basic reasoning, it's about a minute, right? Is why it's never asked. Because if we actually ask the question, there's no amount of delusion of reality that could lead you to any conclusion other than society shouldn't allow the poor to be there. Except that we don't have enough resources, which is once again how Republicans or right-wingers, which include the Democrats, twist reality, we are in a scarcity, we don't have enough, we need to save ourselves, we need to protect our country over others. But it's not true our country and our world can feed everyone. We are in a world of abundance. But sharing it in certain ways is not to the benefit of certain people. So once again, the reason we don't ask this question is because the answer threatens some people's current status quo. So I had to ask you to center this question in your politics. Why are people in a society that could feed, how's and clothe everyone in poverty? Is it because they deserve to be? And if it's not, why are we allowing it to continue?",

Why the fuck would I care? But that's not the question that was asked. The question that was asked is what solution should the West impose upon the Palestinians? And that's the fundamental issue. It's not my choice. I'm not going in writing their constitution because that's their right. I'm not going in drawing their borders. That's their right. But whenever we talk about one, two, three, four, one, state, zero state, whatever state solution, we seem to put ourselves in the position of determining this. And that is an imperial mode of thinking. And let me be clear, that's precisely what these really state wants. They want us to be already in the position of forcing Palestinians to do what we believe to be right. And then the only battle they have to win is their solution being right, not that they should have the right to implement it over the will of the Palestinians. So don't concede that.

But that's not what Israel wants. Israel doesn't want us to learn what actually happened. Israel doesn't want to learn how genocides happen. They want to leverage the memory and trauma of the genocide to push for their own war crimes. Like you yourself do, buy a racing the unique Palestinian identity, because that is the first thing you do in a genocide, is you deny them their very culture or humanity. And then we'd be very clear. Antisemitic arguments, conspiracy theories, and straight up wackos do exist in the pro-Palestine space just as they exist in the Zionist space. I'm no doubt to that, and I have attempted to undermine that as much as conceivably possible in the space. But suggesting that learning from past genocides, the Sabrina Kamasiko, Rwanda Genocide, Arminian Genocide, etc. and the Holocaust, to analyze modern-day events is somehow wrong or insulting to those genocides is insane. What does never again mean to you, if not learning from the atrocities and horrendous actions that were taken the past, to call out and prevent them from happening right now? It is not an insult to the memory of the people that were lost in that genocide. To discuss its similarities modern day. It is an insult to the memory of the people that were lost in that genocide to not learn from their loss. Never again means never again for anyone. And leveraging the memory of the Holocaust to support another one is much more disrespectful to its memory than using the memory of the Holocaust to prevent another one.",

I commented on a few of your videos. You probably saw mine. You ignored them. I'll say it as clearly and openly as possible. Working with fascists will never undermine them. Destiny's a fascist. You worked with him. You won't undermine fascism. If you want to say he's a less bad fascist than other American fascists, I'm going to tell you, I really deep in my soul, don't give a fuck. Now that's the morals. But on the political efficacy point, if you support someone or work with someone, and implicitly platform someone, who pushes for continued support of American imperialism in Israel and support for their terrorist arm in the IDF, you can't undermine American fascism. Because that is American fascism in training. Ice, the thing you claim to be working against, trained with the IDF. Ice uses techniques developed on occupied Palestinians. So if you cannot be effective on the issue of Palestine, which you cannot be working with, Destiny, you are shooting yourself from the foot maybe six months, maybe a year, maybe five years from now, in fairness, when working against ice, when working against homegrown American fascists. And this is what you don't understand. And this is what liberals always put a blind eye to, is that the imperialism that you don't really care about or is maybe a one issue or maybe a purity politics, whatever, is the same thing that will affect domestic American politics. So not only do you have no moral standing, because you worked with a fascist. So you're at the very least complicit in fascism. But you're also just wrong politically. You are wrong to think that Destiny's style of fascism could ever undermine Donald Trump's. They go hand in hand.",

And liberals are saying, how much can we give these fascists to go back to brunch? Is Gavin Newsom enough? And then thinking leftists, the ones who don't want to give up the very values that would allow us to organize effective resistance, such as not throwing our trans siblings under the bus, or not being actively militant against immigrants, or actively harmful to basically every marginalized group that he was a governor under, liberals see us as the ones being unreasonable. When what they are doing is protecting institutions that are going to be destroyed by the fascists, we cannot protect electoral institutions by voting. That is a privilege that we earned through actual direct action and resistance. And they're taking that fucking privilege away. So we need to organize around real, radical, and revolutionary values to get back the privilege to vote our values. Because right now we're not in that privilege. So liberals need to stop seeing leftists as the enemy and start seeing us as the solution. Because that is the only way you're getting back to brunch.",

And this is an unfortunate and extreme example of feminism, specifically liberal feminism, being leveraged to support imperialism. And this is not new, but it is extraordinary. Because feminism, specifically liberal feminism, has been used consistently to support, justify, and manufacture consent for further imperialism, with things like this saying, well, they're men, they're militants, obviously they're evil, so what if they're killed? I will admit this is a new narrative for me. But there are other ones. Like Palestinians just are so oppressive to women, of course, Israel has to interfere. They say that Wall is real continues to oppress women and murder thousands. Or don't you see how they treat gay people? How can you as a liberal not support invading and attacking and murdering their children? So, while this one is insane, because it misunderstands the whole entire point of liberatory politics, which is not to find the right people to attack or undermine or dehumanize, but to remove the systems and societies that do attack undermine and dehumanize people. It is not new, and it fits into a larger function of liberal feminism to support imperialism and the current colonial goals. So I push anyone, I'm not an anti-feminist, I support feminism, but truly liberatory, intersectional, and counter-imperial feminism. Which doesn't do this fucking nonsense.",

The function of this system is what it is doing, and what it is doing is genocide, that is not a mistake, and they are pretty open about that being an intention. The people that are still using breath to talk about the hostages are missing the fucking point. Israel is not advocating for the hostages. The only people that actually care about the hostages, I would posit, are the people that took them, because they are political pressure for them. But they keep getting fucking murdered. What matters right now is ending the system, whose function is to use them as an excuse to murder Palestinians, and that is the Israeli occupying forces.",

This video is one of many, claiming the reason Gaza isn't getting food is because Israel isn't allowing it, but because the UN isn't doing their job. But last but not least, Israel, what is the point of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, if not that exact job that you're claiming? And how the fuck is the UN meant to do their job? When you made the wing of the UN that would do this, UNRA, a registered terrorist organization, you habitually murder UN organization and people. And now you've moved from you don't owe them food to we are giving them food, the starvation and famine is a lie, to the new lie which is okay maybe there is a famine but it's not our job, it's not our fault. So this new lie is just pathetic and relies on us for getting everything that we have thought or seen you ever say. Because first you said the famine in starvation wasn't happening, is it not happening or is it the UN's fault? Then you said it was happening because Hamas was stealing aid, was it happening because Hamas was stealing aid or because the UN wasn't delivering any aid? The two can't be true at the same time. But every international report showed there was a famine happening, an American report showed that Hamas did not steal significant aid. And now you're on your last fly, blaming the organization that you banned from the area for surprise, surprise, not being in the area after you murdered a bunch of them. Israel you are slaughtering these people and when you don't slaughter them you allow them to starve. Nothing will hide these lies anymore and it is embarrassing and disgusting for every single individual that goes on one of these propaganda trips. Supports any single one of these videos or doesn't use every piece of political capital they have to condemn a bash and attack this despicable state action.",

But what's being missed here is this discussion was never had when colonization happened. In America, why should immigrants conform to the white European culture when white Europeans didn't conform to the Native American culture? The very concept that we, as people that live in former or current colonies, have any stones to throw to tell the new people coming into these colonies how to act or which customs to engage in? Is white supremacy? It is only built off the idea inherently that our customs of course take precedence, justified on the very thinly veiled justification of them coming first because they're better. What if this new custom corrupts us? What if they undermine our culture? No, we must reject this in its entirety. Of course, actual Indigenous people have the right to live actually Indigenous lives. Us in the colonial, north and west do not have that. And we have no right to tell the new colonizers to follow the old colonizers ways.",

There's a key factor to genocide, and that is the bonus speciality of the intent. And for the first time in history, Israel gives a fuck about the law. So let's explain what Dolas Specialis is before this asshole does. Typically, to commit a crime, you have to have an actous race, you have to do the act, and you have to have the mens-raya, the intention behind it, right? And the mens-raya typically is merely the intention to do the act. Most simple way to put this is a general intention is the intention to do what you do. So for a salt, if you move your arm and you hit someone, the intention element that you need is to have intended to move your arm. But for murder, which has a special intention, you not only need to intend to attack someone, but you also need to intend that they die or have grievous bully harm from that attack. Not only intending to do what you do, but also there's a consequence or some other intention behind it. Now, I wonder what he thinks it is? So normally, if you commit a crime, once in a quarter, it would be the burden of proof, it would be beyond reasonable depth. 90% plus it can be the uncertainty that you'd committed to crime. But the bonus specialist, it's 100%, it cannot be anything. So this is just so incredibly far off base. Dolas Specialis has absolutely nothing to do with burden of proof. As I said, it has to do with what you are proving, not burden of proof. And the Dolas Specialis for genocide is the intention not only to kill, starve, or kidnap, children from a certain ethnic group, but to do so with the intention to destroy in-hole or in part that ethnic group. And Israel is clearly doing that. Not just well beyond a reasonable doubt, but also by their own words. Ben Gavir has said that they should expel every Arab from that territory or kill them. That man is in the government currently. Benjamin and Yahu is in the Lecude party, which is a far right-wing extremist group that does not believe that Arab should live on that land. This person is providing such a laughably stupid piece of propaganda. Number one, it's just not true. That is a flagrantly falsified definition of Dolas Specialis. But number two, with the correct understanding of it is obvious how Israel is engaged in it. So please, Israel, don't stop caring about the law now. You've broken it. Just turn yourself in.",

Aaron Parnas was a neutral reporter who seemed to focus mostly on the hostages and internal Israeli politics. But when it is Putin, he is willing to break journalistic neutrality and actively condemn them. What's different, Aaron? I know it's personal to you, but it is disgusting for you to do it for that atrocity and not the mass genocide that is being funded by American dollars. This is not new and this is a long saga of me being desperately disappointed by Aaron as a journalist. But it is an incredible new leaf that you are clearly willing to stop your pretense of being a journalist to condemn people when it is a war criminal you care about or affects your family personally. You're not a war criminal that America is directly, consistently and systemically funding. You're complicit.",

The invisible hand of freedmen like economics doesn't stop at borders and he admits this, but most capitalists don't, and I would argue very clearly, that that is because it is not in the interest of capital to allow human labor to flourish. Because the goal of capital is not to provide the freest market. The goal of capital is to exploit the workers as much as possible, and separating the workers into different nations, into different cultures, into different anything. Allows them to be more exploitable. For example, European labor unions famously have achieved quite large labor protections. But if they were organized with African labor unions or Asian labor unions, the primary demand would not be domestic labor protections. It would either be harmonized labor protections with Africa or Asia or free immigration to those places that have better labor protections. But the exact opposite is true. French labor unions tend to be anti-immigration, tend to maintain some form of nationalist ideal. And in this way, they play they part in maintaining the exploitation of the global sales human capital. That is how this system works. So whenever someone tells you, I just believe in a free market, ask them if they believe in a free market of human capital. And if they don't, they don't believe in a free market. They believe in the most profitable exploitation of human labor. And no capitalist model functions to account for this, except for the one taking into account imperialism.",

I'm sorry, I don't have my muscle shirt on, but like... credentials? Anyway, that's the choice we have. Say the government needs to raise a million dollars. Do they tax the bottom 50%, and then that 50% has to pay 100% of the million dollars, or do they tax the rich, and then some of it is passed down because they can through price flexibility, etc. But a certain like big brain economist men have figured out that a certain amount of it is actually eaten by the rich. That's why sales tax, which go directly to the consumer, hit the consumer more than value added tax, right, which hit at every stage of production. And we know the past three because people actually fucking study this. So that's why your argument's wrong. There's a past three rate. So that's why you have to see that the average of it is passed through, but it is still more taking from rich people than it is poor people. Then they 100% passed through rate, which is your alternative. The actual argument that is actually presented by better right wing propagandists than yourself, whose only credentials seem to be like Jim, is that the wealthy will leave with their assets, and that is actually a negative to our tax, right, that's what it is like Charlie Kirk said. So that's wrong because you can't leave with every asset, for example, and mainly land. You can strip them of their assets if they leave and stop paying tax, which is what we should do. But you didn't present that argument because you actually don't know what you're talking about. So I'll leave it at that.",

The exploitative nature of it is when capital steals their labor. And then they go, but you can't really consent to sex when money is exchanged. Okay, can you consent to coalworking, which harms your lungs? Can you consent to working in a factory or a risk becoming paraplegic? No, because money is involved. Should those things of labor be illegal? Should they be demonized? Should they be excluded from the labor movement? No, they are the ones we want to protect. So when you want any of those things for sex workers, when you want them to be illegal, or demonized, or excluded from the labor movement, you are not advocating for laborers. You are not advocating against exploitation of laborers. You are removing them from the movement that would end their exploitation.",

Every post I see, especially from liberals just now condemning a genocide, are about the women and children being slaughtered in Palestine. But it is important to recognize that Israel wants those to be the focus. They are a tragedy, every single one. But the men being slaughtered in Palestine also are, whether they worked for the government in Gaza or they didn't. And this narrative helps two Israeli goals that compound. First of all, if you say, if you mourn just the women in children, they are justified in slaughtering every single man in Palestine. That is just as much genocide as slaughtering everyone. But number two, if we view this primarily as a save the children or women who are infantilized down to children by sexist narratives, then it is going to infantilize the Palestinian people. Suddenly the issue is not, they are not allowed to govern themselves. Of course, children aren't allowed to govern themselves. Suddenly the issue is they are dying. We need to take care of them. paternalism and paternalism justifies further violation of Palestinian self-determination, which is what precisely is real once. Maybe even Israel can't get away with occupying it, but maybe America can go in and say, we're just taking care of the women and children. No, the correct answer is to recognize that they were slaughtered people but are a human people that can govern themselves and the reason Israel's focusing on them just as victims as women and children is if that is what is left or if that is what you mourn and you justify killing all the men, what you think of is a non-self-governing, capable people. And that justifies further imperialism. So please, when you're talking about Palestine, treat it like other genocide. It is not just sad that women died. It is not just sad that children died. It is sad that humans died. And it is sad most importantly that humans were slaughtered by other humans.",

Don't really care about oppressed people because they are critiquing Gavin Newsom before he has announced his run for presidency. Before he has even gone into a primary and certainly before he is the Democratic nominee, somehow we are harming the Democratic cause. If we cannot critique the Democrats right now, when the fuck can we critique them? If we can't critique them during the election because that's helping the fascists. And we can't critique them during the fascist overtaking how the fuck can we prevent the Democrats from becoming fascists? When? When? The answer is never. That's the answer because they don't think the leftist critique of Gavin Newsom is fair. They don't care. They like the guy because this was never about undermining fascism. It was about making fascism look a bit nicer, a bit more decent, a bit more tolerant. And if we understand liberal critique from that era, from that view, it becomes very clear. They are doing what fascists do. Silent leftist dissent. They are just doing it in a distinctively liberal way. So yeah, I'm going to critique the guy that grins as unhoused people get brutalized by the fucking gestapo in California. And if the Democrats want support from people that actually give a fuck about human rights, which I have a feeling will be slightly more people by the time of 2028. They'll nominate someone that doesn't do that shit.",

But number two is weapons. Oh shit. Ten of our economy is oil and weapons. And so as we're thinking about organizing American workers, it's going to be hard to make the argument to de-empire, to remove our empire because a lot of people's work, a lot of people's aims, a lot of people's money is tied up in weapons and oil. And those are tools of empire. The only reason they are so profitable for us, number one is because we keep starting wars, that we need more and more and more expensive weapons in, and we keep starting wars so that we control the global oil supply. So this is a bit of a pickle, isn't it? You know, but my solution, the thing I keep coming back to, is that as a portion of our jobs, it doesn't actually take that much. Right? Oil and weapons is pretty big in terms of our economy. But in terms of the Americans working there, it's not a majority of us. So it still means most Americans are not interested in maintaining this, and actually most Americans are harmed by this. Whether that be oil rigs that are poisoning their water, weapons factories that are poisoning their water, or air, or simply having people that have been lost from it. So it is possible, but we need to keep in mind which workers are working for the empire, and how to remove them from that, and how to build industry and economy that allows them to leave that, and then which workers are genuinely disaligned with the empire. Organize those first, and then build community such that the ones that can't be organized as laborers, can continue to be living in dignity as humans.",

You're citing human rights watch to attack countries that I didn't defend. I actually condemn these countries for their treatment of LGBTQ people consistently.

They're telling the truth when it comes to Arabs, but when it comes to Israelis, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, they're anti-Semitic, disgusting, and totally untrustworthy. What? The lower level of delusion I often encounter with Zionist is they just say everything's anti-Semitic and has total no bearing on reality. But saying that it just has a bearing on reality when it benefits you and having the audacity to cite a well-respected human rights journal that has really quite honestly reported on Israel is incredible.

I was raised thinking of coal workers or factory workers. But those are almost all gone. We don't have that many factories in America anymore. And we certainly don't have that many coal mines. But you know who is still oppressed? You know who's interested or genuinely disaligned with the American Empire? Prisoners. There's slaves. Sex workers. They are illegal. And I make this point not to just say prison's bad. They are. Or sex works should be performed. It should. But I say it as we start talking about how to organize the working class, we may fall into some pitfalls. If we start counting managers at a Raytheon factory as the working class, which I guess they are, right? They were oppressed in so far as their workers in capitalism. But they are not actively oppressed by the American Empire in the same way, for example, a prisoner would be. Or a person forced into the American military would be. And because of that, it is not only sometimes not useful because they aren't interested in helping, but it's often counterproductive because they may actually be interested in maintaining some of the structures of imperialism while reducing its nasty face. And that's my friends is where we get liberalism. So as we think about how to liberate America from the increasingly more visible fascism that is within it, we need to think about organizing the people that are most fundamentally oppressed by it, most fundamentally at odds with the American Empire's goals. And that is where we will find the leaders and the movements and the actual struggles that will push for change in America. We cannot have another round of bourgeois unions in America.

The most powerful propaganda tool Israel has is the fear of another Holocaust. So when we are advocating for the abolition of the ethnic state of Israel, we must ensure that those liberatory politics prevent rather than reify the structures that led to ethnic cleansing of Jews across Europe. And let me be very clear, this is not equating the two. What I am saying is that Israel was founded upon the idea that instead of abolishing the racial structures that oppressed Jews for millennia, instead of undermining those, they would create one that put them at the top. That is what ethnic states are. They are a piece of land where one race or one ethnicity is put at the top and it is maintained by the fear that they will be at the bottom if they are anywhere else. And how you undermine that both is by critiquing it, attacking it and disempowering it, but also ensuring that that fantasy that justifies it is not true. We must work to abolish all racial structures, all ethnic structures, all national structures, such that that fear of being placed at the bottom of the racial hierarchy, the ethnic hierarchy, and eventually being want to have gotten rid of is so divorced from reality that it cannot justify an ethnic cleansing, a genocide and an ethnic state that is real once. So when we say Zionism is anti-Semitism, when we say that the Palestinian Libertory struggle is connected to all other Libertory struggles, this is what we mean. They are so interconnected that undermining racism and anti-Semitism in America, undermining anti-Semitism built into Europe actually does undermine Israel because Israel is constituent of it.",

    "text": "Israel has murdered five more journalists in one strike yesterday, one of them being a very famous Al Jazeera staff. And as we have learned, Israel has three tools in its toolbox when shit like this happens. Deny, justify, or blame. This time they didn't choose to deny it like they did. They murdered Shrine in cold blood. They aren't saying it's a Hamas missile like they did with about three of the hospitals they bombed. But they're saying that it was justified because he was a leader of a Hamas terror cell, a flagrantly and demonstrably untrue statement that no credible media organization should be repeating. Myself included, by the way. Sorry. This is part of their game. With those three things, they do whatever the fuck they want with impunity. When it gets proven they did murder someone, they blame Hamas. When they could prove it wasn't Hamas, they say the person murdered was Hamas. This is not new, but it is particularly despicable, given how hard these people worked to uncover and demonstrate the monstrosities and crimes of Israel. Do not forget their names and do not forget these crimes because one day, Israel, however much it does, one of those three things will be held to justice. And we must always remember.",

    "text": "Do you keep getting asked, do you want a one state or two state solution? How do you solve this? The correct answer is, I don't care. The Palestinians can have one state, they can have two states, they can make themselves 15 goddamn states if they want. What matters is self-determination of the people which is a fundamental human right. And when we get asked this question, it is never a question of how do we best free Palestine? It is always a question of which neighborhoods should we segregate, which neighborhoods should we slice up, which cultures should we erase? Because the second you start drawing the borders on native homelands, you separate people, you ethnically cleanse people, you deprive people of their fundamental rights. And that is colonization. So there is no answer other than whatever the fuck the Palestinian people want. Was the correct answer to apartheid South Africa to partition the white people away? No, it was to abolish the racial hierarchy that was created by the colonizers in the first place. And the exact same thing must be done here. You must reject the Zionist ideal of, okay, maybe we can give enough lands back to the natives, like America did, that they will just be quiet and we'll try and kill as many of them before we have to do that as well. No, we have to force them to stop ethnically cleansing and stop engaging in apartheid. And there is no discussion that maintains a state of Israel that includes that.",

In the next week, next month, you're going to see a lot of people that full-throw-dally supported the genocide, suddenly focusing on condemning Netanyahu. And ignoring the fact that this genocide, this ethnic cleansing, this expulsion and erasure of Palestinians has been going on well before Netanyahu existed, much less was in power, and much less was doing war crimes. And that's because they want to maintain the structures that caused fascism, that caused the genocide, but they want to get rid of the public face currently doing it. And this is why we call it liberal Zionism. It is still Zionism. It is still supporting the ethno-state that necessitates genocide. It's just unwilling to realize that that's the natural consequence. And by the way, this happens in America as well, right? Obama was the porter in chief. Biden massively increased the ice budget. It's only when Trump gets in office and does it quite openly, does it quite publicly, does it quite brutally? Suddenly Democrats discover human rights. So let's remember, it is the material reality, not the individuals that are the consequence of the material reality, causing the problems. Netanyahu is not to be blamed. I mean, here's where we should throw him the egg. But we should also abolish the fucking country that is committing the genocide, that was set up to commit the genocide, that is maintaining itself with the genocide.",

The military learned this a long time ago. If the US government can make the only option for impoverished people in America to either join the military or ICE, not only do they provide themselves with reasons to impoverish people, but they also get people that are on death, ground fighting for them. And those are the damn best fighters that are willing to do right about damn anything. ICE doesn't want privileged wealthy people joining their forces. That's why their forces are overwhelmingly very similar to the people they're deporting. Because if you get people who have no other option, they'll do anything you want. That makes our job a whole lot clearer. Our job is to make it not worth it to join ICE. Our job is to make the money not worth it and to provide communities and support and aid so that it's not ever required of anyone. That's a big ask and we're not gonna do it overnight. But those are the two ways you attack it. Make it not the fuck worth it, socially, financially, personally and physically, and make it possible to get out, socially, financially and physically. If we do that, we can really undermine the current occupying army in America. Not quickly, maybe not enough, but that's the only option we got.",

And the biggest issue with this is who decides if you've integrated enough. Do you move to a majority Christian society? Do you have an obligation to convert? Or what if that society's super racist and doesn't believe that, for example? Jewish people could be part of this society ever. Do you have an obligation to just never live there? No, because integration is not an admirable goal. Coexistence is. Because if you can't live peacefully with someone who's different than you as your next-door neighbor, how the fuck are your countries going to live peacefully next to each other? They won't. You have a bunch of people growing up around people that are different than them, and being fine with that, they're a lot harder to get into silly, silly wars. But if you have a bunch of people that are all the same, any amount of difference, even on the TV, will motivate them to anger, because that's how big a tree is built. Not only is this ideology wrong, where the fuck would such a moral obligation come from? Right, you can go to a country and be respectful of their culture, just as they should be respectful of yours. But it also breeds bigotry, and it's also really easy to weaponize. The second, there's a certain amount of integration that's required. It will be weaponized against the minorities that just simply can't integrate ethnic minorities, religious minorities, gender minorities. If we think they must be this similar to pass, there are some people that will never, ever pass. And what do you do with them? History has the answer, and it's really fucking nasty.",

Not any fucking time I know, because you're not interested in coalition building. You're using this to brow-beat leftists! By the way, this was left on a video of me talking about how liberals should be welcomed into the pro-Palestinian movement, and I actually advocated grace for them supporting war criminals. I just also noted that they supported war criminals, and said that because of that, they should sit down and get to work and not get on their high horse about morals right now, because they were also immoral. I was also immoral for the years I didn't support actively and openly Palestine. But when you do dumb shit like this, you're showing your hand really clearly. Us calling you war criminals which you are when you support a fascist authoritarian ethno-state like Israel, you're a war criminal because they're committing war crimes that you're supporting, that's not a political statement, that's just a fact of international law. Saying that fact angers you more than you care about solving the war crime. And if that's who I have to go with, if those are the principles I have to compromise, critiquing actual fascist states in order to work with you, you're not fighting fascism, you're apologizing for it.",

So please, come fight with us, come work against it, but you need to own up to what that means. When you supported them, you supported a war crime. When they supported Israel, they engaged in war crimes. And you and them and Israel need to be held to account. Because this is not new information, people have been screaming about the war crime that was being committed for the past few decades. You just now decided to listen better than never, but much worse than earlier. So my suggestion to you is to sit down and listen to the people you've been ignoring for the past few years and actually get to work. Pressure, every single liberal that has not spoken up to start screaming. Every single organization working with Israel, start boycotted, learn, listen, and get the fuck to work. Because when is liberals enter a movement, they tend to co-opt it. And that is the most dangerous thing a movement can go through.",

    "text": "Did you know that most South African war criminals were pardoned? Some reason, talking about the end of an apartheid genocidal state seems prescient right now. And so, two Israelis and two people advocating for Palestine, I want to talk about the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Following apartheid, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was set up to engage in restorative justice because they knew they couldn't throw every single person that committed a war crime in apartheid South Africa in jail. You would throw almost all the white people in jail that would destroy a society. But they also knew that if they didn't properly address the injustices and engage in truth and reconciliation, it would return or re-empower. They did this, was requiring would-be criminals to come to the commission, testify, engage in a trial, typically be found guilty, but then by and large be pardoned, or pay nominal fines or engage in community building. It's a lot more complicated than that and the system was incredibly extensive and it still has not let all criminals off the hook most certainly and it hasn't even addressed all the criminals. But what it does do is set a new society up to succeed by not ignoring the crimes of the past but leveraging them to build a new, better, and more just future. It's not a perfect system and I'm by no means an expert. Now listen to me, look more into it. But I mention this because as we look into the fall of the Israeli state, which I genuinely, maybe I'm too radical, but have no doubt will happen. We must, must, as unfortunate as it is, convince the current Nazis in charge of Israel that they are not on death ground. These people have nuclear bombs. If the state of Israel, if the citizens of Israel genuinely believe their propaganda that the end of an Israeli state means another Holocaust, there will be no peaceful, resolute, or helpful ending to this conflict. That is not me calling for forgiveness. It is not my genocide to forgive, but it is me saying as we talk to Zionists, as we talk about Israel, as we talk to Israelis, we must make them aware that there is a life following this, a life that involves engaging in justice, engaging in accountability, but a life following it. Not an end to their people, but a recognition of the fundamental rights of all people. And the end of apartheid's South Africa is a pretty damn good model for this, just as the rise of apartheid's South Africa and the continuation of it is a pretty damn good model of what Israel is doing right now.",

Because yes, they get paid either way, but if they're sent to a hiring fair, for example, they don't get their job done as well if you are talking to them the whole time. And the goal is for it to be harder for them to hire more Gestapo people. So let's just play out the scenarios. You don't talk to them. They talk to impressionable young people and get more people to come in. Not only does that mean there are more trainees to do evil nonsense, but if there are more trainees, you don't get paid them as much. So you get more evil for less money, so Trump gets more done with less money. Whereas everyone, all the time, when they see ICE recruiting, they go up and get, oh, tell me about the job. Oh, tell me how much I get paid. Oh, what are the requirements? Well, I have a dog I need to take care of. Do I have family members in it? Take up their time. Less impressionable young people talk to at a recruitment fair. Less Gestapo members that are being paid. Less evil stuff done. Do we see how this works? Okay, good.",

The Daily Signal of Right-wing Propaganda outlet is pissed that Republicans are funding the National Endowment for Democracy. And you know what? So am I. For y'all who don't know, the National Endowment for Democracy was founded to literally replace some of the public broadcasting functions that the CIA had covertly developed during and after the Vietnam War. They fund propaganda sites such as Radio Free Asian, Radio Free Europe, which push American Imperial propaganda. Let's fucking go. If we have to get mad at them for being woke and believing in gender identity and divisive racial programs to get rid of this absolute shit hole of a program that is literally been pushing American Imperial propaganda for the past decades, you got me, brother. We're gonna work together because this is literally the privatized CIA. And that's not like me saying that. Ned literally at its founding said that they were taking over some of the public relations functions of the CIA. It's not a secret. A lot of their functions like Radio Free Asia was founded by the CIA and were taken over. We shouldn't be funding them and while we're at that, maybe get rid of the CIA as a whole.",

It's not to pat liberals on the back, I'm so proud you're slightly less progenocide than where you were yesterday. All good work. It is to provide the resources, the information, and the argumentation, so as to allow them to be actual left-leiners. Right? How do you actually engage in leftist activism? How do you actually engage in leftist thought? How do you actually engage in direct action in mutual aid? All these things, you need an ideological backbone for, and if I am unwilling to critique the people undermining that ideological backbone, I'm fucking useless. So I want to be clear what's happening here. Democrats are only thinking about voting. That's what, like, you talk to a Democrat, that one mode of action is voting. This like happens all the time. And yeah, if I critique Kamala, that is mildly giving fodder to the other side to use. But I don't think in just voting. I think in building communities that can actually resist, building ice watch organizations, building mutual aid organizations like food, nut bombs, etc. And in order to do that, you need people that won't work with the cops. You need people that won't support genocide. You need people that are uncomfortable with actual fascist thought. And in order to do that, you need to undermine and criticize that fascist thought from whoever it's coming from. So in organizing spaces, you need to build broad coalitions, but also be able to critique intracoellition. That is the space that the internet is for. I don't fucking know you. I don't fucking know Aaron. My critiques of him are performative. They are to educate people watching that this behavior is unacceptable. I'm not a kingmaker in the Democratic Party. I'm not saying Aaron can't be anything because of blah, blah, blah, I'm not saying that we shouldn't try and build power where we can. I'm saying that I, as a political critic, are going to politically critique everyone that does something wrong so that I can have a more mature, nuanced and intelligent audience to actually get shit done. All elaborate on this, but I feel like this is just becoming a rant. But also he's not doing honest reporting. His reporting on the admin is fine, but he plagiarizes every one of his headlines. He's not reporting. He's repeating. So I don't really respect him as a reporter, but that's more personal. That's nothing to do with the point. I just, you know, whatever.",

What's highlighted to me in my history was that they actually work together in Poland, which is true, but that's a specific regime working with another specific regime. I just spent an afternoon watching fascist propaganda, and I can tell you, these fascists vitriolically hate communists. And actually, fundamental to their anti-Semitism, because don't get me wrong, they are extremely anti-Semitic, they hate communists, and they think it's connected. And this is fucking scary for me, because I am very interested in being able to combat fascist ideology propaganda and points. But if I'm not taught what they believe accurately, I can't do that, and neither can you. Not only that, I think we weren't taught it correctly, because a lot of these points look like a lot of what America has been saying about communism. That it's a big conspiracy that it want to make everyone all the same, that it caused 100 million deaths. That last one explicitly comes from the victims of communism fund, which is viralently anti-Semitic, surprise, surprise. When we are talking about undermining fascism, especially the modern fascism that's coming out, if you're up in America right now, we must understand where it actually comes from, and actually unpack a lot of what we were taught that helped create that modern fascism. And a lot of that came in the form of anti-communist rhetoric, because first they came for the communists is the phrase. And if we don't take that to heart, they're going to come for the rest of us too.",

Israel is required by international law, which is slowly becoming all too fucking real for them to allow aid to flow into the area. Their violation of it is only further evidence of their genocidal intent of the Palestinians. And no amount of show theater of throwing parachuted boxes that literally murder children into Gaza will prevent that fucking complicity and destruction of Palestinians from being apparent to the rest of the world.

    "text": "Criticizing the actions of Israel is a criticizing all Jews, then all Jews are responsible for the actions of Israel. That is collective responsibility and that is anti-Semitism. Let's be very clear. If I held all black people to account for the actions of South Africa, for example, that would be racist. If I held all Catholics responsible for the actions of the Vatican, that would be bigoted. But that is exactly the game that Israel is playing whenever they call their critics anti-Semitic, for merely pointing out that war crimes are in fact crimes. It sustains Israel because it does two things. It scares people with the memory of extraordinary anti-Semitism and it puts Jewish people on death ground. If they feel that the end of Israel is the end of them, if they identify their identity, their actions, their existence with the existence and actions of Israel, however anti-Semitic doing that as an outsider may be, it means they're willing to sacrifice their existence, their life, their engagement with for the existence and maintenance of Israel. So it is a internal and external propaganda tool. Not only does it build an effective self-defense mechanism because it puts millions of Jewish people across the world on death ground to defend Israel, but it also threatens any critics against Israel with the history and label of anti-Semitic. But it is most important not only to understand why Israel is doing it, but what will actually happen? If they continue to conflate the two, people will start doing so too, but on the opposite side. As Israel's war crimes become much more clear, they will start identifying those war crimes with all Jewish people. That's fucking dangerous. That makes Jewish people across the world more scared, more in fear, more in real physical danger. It's anti-Semitic. So Israel's not going to hear me, but as you hear Israeli propagandists, Zionists propagandists engage in this, ask them why they are putting Jewish people at risk, why are they being anti-Semitic? And you can explain actually how it's anti-Semitic because it physically puts Jewish people in more danger.",

    "text": "If probably her Trump talk about anarchists, the Marxists, and Antifa. But what the fuck is Antifa? And why is this stupid? So first and foremost, Antifa stands for Antifascists. So it is more a movement of people that do Antifascist work. Antifascist work looks like a lot of things, but what you would be most familiar with is what we would call the Black Block. Which is people that step up and prefect against violence of fascists. And sometimes, allegedly, do violence against fascists that are threatening communities on the basis of their fascism. I.e., it is a movement of people that take a series of strategies against fascism and fascists to undue fascist negative impacts. And you'll often hear from Centrist that because they sometimes use violence, most of which is in self-defense, but sometimes it's what is real would call preemptive self-defense. But because they use violent techniques, they're just as bad as the thing they're defending against. I first have to ask, would you say that of the original anti-fascist, the fucking Allied forces? I don't think you'd say America was just as bad as Nazi Germany. But besides that, but more fundamental than that, victims of fascist violence are victims because of something they cannot change. Being Jewish, being gay, being trans, etc. But by and large, victims, if you want to call them that, of anti-fascist violence, number one are typically victims because of something they can change. And they will be left alone, typically, if they stop being a fucking fascist. But second of all, the vast majority of the people that are victims of anti-fascist violence are committers of violence themselves. The reason they get targeted is because they are engaging in actively violent movements that call for insurrection and attack on ethnic or gender or sexual minorities. So you can say this is unjustified and I can't advocate it because it is illegal, but it is not the same. There is a fundamental difference between being attacked for your political ideology or because of your active threats to other groups and those threats to other groups on basis of ethnicity, race or religion. They are different things, they are not equivicable, and it is disgusting to equivocate them.",

So if I have to deal with some loud noises, well I don't my fur fucking hood and robes that they wore as well, I will tolerate that.

    "text": "Wow, you don't agree with the most paranoid skit-so interpretation of every piece of media? Not terribly surprising, someone willing to use that language is not terribly equipped to recognize the stepping stones to eugenics, but all the dress the points you made. The main point you made, the only actual argument made, was that it was a slippery slope fallacy that recognizing any genetic reality could be construed as eugenics. And so that, I say, doing so in an ad that idealizes certain beauty and looks and relates it to genetics, yes, should be critically analyzed for its connection to eugenics. Because this is not a science class, this is not a textbook, this is not a biology class, this is an ad for a fashion brand by a fashion model who is told that they look socially attractive, this is an idealization, this is a value, and the issue, primarily if I was to sum up generally the issue with eugenics, is that it is a inherently value-lated system, cause playing as effective science. And that fundamental value system underlying this point, the idealization of certain views and then correlation of that with genetics, which is a stepping stone to eugenics, that's what you're missing, you're not understanding how that's the issue with eugenics. Because eugenicists did some science experiments that were correct, some of their science was factually correct, the vast majority was factually wrong, but the problematic part was not that they were wrong, the problematic part was that they started suggesting evaluative solutions to social problems that came with the idealization of certain traits, and you are not clocking this at all. And I agree, the internet is like bad at discourse, right? Really bad at discourse. But that doesn't mean that people who look at this ad and go, that focus and idealization of genetic traits in society is maybe problematic and reminiscent of eugenics, not a little bit more crazy. And if you read, for example, and you were interested in academic literature on this issue, you would see the incredible stark similarity that modern day America in propaganda and advertisement has to historical fascist propaganda. But you're not, you're mad that people called you out online, and then you use Davilist language to defend yourself. So you're not interested in defending against eugenics, you're promoting it, right? Saying it's a take is eugenicist, it's ableist, it's it's no one can take this seriously.",

And these unnamed peers really irresponsible reporting by the way, they are pro-Israel lobbyists. So these Zionist lobbyists claim that, oh, we can't recognize Palestinian, statehood, we respect international law too much, and the international law in question is the Montevideo criterion. Those being a permanent population, a defined territory, a government, and capacity to enter into relations with other states, which Palestine does have, they've the PA and defined territory within them. But this claim is that they don't have a defined territory, which is nonsense, but there's a bigger issue. The issue is, apparent to anyone who knows anything about this, those aren't legally binding. They are generally guidelines, but we recognize Bosnia, despite them not having complete control over their territory, we recognize Georgia's proper boundaries, despite them not having full control of their territory. Ukraine, we recognize states all the time that don't have full control over their territory, and thus don't fulfill the full Montevideo criteria. Beyond that, there is a much more obvious issue, genocide is against international law. If we give a fuck about genocide, you do anything and everything to prevent it. The only state you might have an argument that you can't legally recognize is one produced out of severe war crimes, like we didn't recognize the ban two stands in South Africa. And you know who that would be? Israel. You don't recognize states that commit genocide, or have to commit genocide in order to create themselves. That would be Israel. So if these people gave even vaguely two fucks about international law, they would be calling for the non-recognition of Israel in the recognition of 1948 Palestine, because that is the international legal standard. That is why we don't recognize the Northern Turkish Republic of Cyprus, even though it does fulfill the Montevideo criterion.",

They didn't start with selective breeding. They started with the idealization and centrality of genetics in beauty. This is what people don't understand about propaganda. It's not about getting you from A to C. It's about getting you from A to B so you can then get to C. It's about normalization and cultural change, such that when we centralize and when you realize eventually we come to our own conclusions that they like. And it is objectively clear that when you centralize certain beauty and you centralize the fact that beauty comes from genetics, the natural conclusion of that is that we want more of those genes. That we think this is the goal of society. This is the central value. And that leads to eugenical thinking. And this is a hard argument to make with people who are unwilling to be even vaguely media literate. Obviously centralizing certain beauty standards, especially when it is a white, blonde, haired, blue-eyed woman who fits what we think of when eugenicists or eugenics is going to promote the culture that that came from. That's the idea. If you're not interested in understanding how eugenics fed itself into the popular culture, you don't have to be. But historically this is how they did it.",

He has not taken any moves to restrict aid or weapons or military or intelligence support of going to Israel. He just wants to get away with it. And this is a plea with the radical right-wing fanatics that are currently not hiding the genocide in Israel very well. To be a little quieter. We don't want them to be quieter.

The UN has condemned them for denying aid into it, and the UN has been made illegal in parts by Israel. UNRA, the UN Relief Works Agency, has been labeled as a terrorist group in Israel. The guy that was speaking is Elon that be a paid Israeli propagandist. It is Israel starving Gaza and costing thousands of lives. Do not buy a new lie. It is not Hamas starving Gaza, a US report, a US report found that there was a very, very little evidence of any theft of aid, much less on the scale that would be required to cause starvation. In Israel's starvation, Israel's famine, Israel's genocide. Don't let them shift the blame again.",

I can't run through every example, but I will note that the propaganda that fascists historically used against queer people, for example, the tropes of them being groomers and going after children and being infectious, is exactly that has to be familiar to you when you interact with any person even vaguely on the right today. But it goes even further, the characterization of communists as wanting to get rid of all individualization and wanting to murder millions, is a characterization created firstly by fascists and was used to justify mass prosecution of anyone slightly on the left. And that's not even mentioning the massive amount of anti-Semitic tropes that are built into the anti-communist tropes. It's all interconnected, it's all very complicated, but right about fucking none of it was taught to me in school. And that's fucking scary because I, when I actually go back and learn this because that's what I've been doing for quite a while now, going and trying to understand what fascist mean when they say crazy shit, when I go see them, when I go talk to them, I hear a lot of the shit. That sounds pretty fucking familiar. I cannot get out of my head, gaze against groomers, which is almost verbatim a characterization of gay people that the Nazis used. It's scary that this wasn't taught to us because history is repeating itself.",

Join the movement to end the genocide or you will not be on the right side of history. So may message to people that have yet to speak up. You still can, please do, we still expect you to. And my message to people like myself that have been talking about this for literally more than two years, you don't have to like the new people, you don't have to like the liberals that come in and try and co-op the movement, try and take it down. What you should do is welcome them in, use them, and then hold them to account when the genocide is over. Because right now what matters is saving Palestinian lives. Right now what matters is ending the blockade. Punishing war crimes matters a whole lot but that can be done in the heyg after. So let's get the fuck to work and we need liberals to shut the fuck up, sit the fuck down and get working with us. So to organizers, I'm frustrated too. I don't like them.

    "text": "Anists can never actually defend against anti-Semitism because they're unwilling to attack anti-Arab racism. And the two go hand at hand. And this history is very long, but for example, if you go back and look at what was said about Jewish people and Muslim people in the Spanish Inquisition, it was very similar. They were both heathens from a different place that should go back to where they're from or convert to Christianity and Catholicism, but they will never be pure enough. That same orientalism, that same belief that they are from a distant, far-strange land, justified the colonialism of the Arab territories, and the oppression of Jews at home. It was the same language. Then with the advent of racial science and fascism on the basis of it, Jews and Arabs were seen as the same people that's where anti-Semitism comes from. Semites is a term made up by racial scientists that labels both Jews and many Arab speakers. Developed into just Jews, but specifically was used to categorize them in kind. And the modern state of Israel cannot tackle anti-Semitism, not only because their whole entire state relies on the fear of the Jewish people of another massive, harmful event happening. Also, because it is founded on anti-Arab racism, theater hurtsle explicitly compared Arabs to dogs and animals. Ben Giorgi on the first president of Israel said that they wanted to expel all Arabs from the territory, and in modern day, Benjamin Netanyahu and Ben Giorgi have explicitly called Ben Giorgi at least for a ethno-state where Arabs cannot vote. It is essential to design this project that anti-Arab racism maintain and continue. And as long as that does, those same tropes that were used and weaponized and developed to oppress Jewish people will come through in this project. They are ill-equipped and actually completely debilitated from undermining the foundations of anti-Semitism, as long as they maintain the ethno-state founded on anti-Arab racism.",

A lot of his economic policies were actually very similar to those of Mussolini's. Put very simply, the danger of social democracy is that it calms down the working class just enough to prevent a revolution, but doesn't do enough to actually solve the fucking problem. It reifies the system and sets the seeds for fascism later. And that is exactly what a social Democrat will do today. They may and we're seeing them, guys. We are seeing the slight push to the left in the Democrats that will genuinely help people's life. That is true and I'm not advocating against that. But not nearly enough to solve it for the next 10, 15, 20 years, and lay the groundwork for the fascist white resentment that will come in those 10, 20 years. Meaning fundamental revolutionary change, not an outgrowth of the very system that laid the groundwork for fascists today.",

    "text": "You hear a lot about anti-Semitism and Zionists, but never about anti-Arab racism. Despite their movement being full of it. And in fact, Theodore Hertzel, one of the four fathers of modern political Zionism, was an astounding anti-Arab racism to believe and compare Arabs to animals. Ben Gureon explicitly said they would need to expel Arabs from the land to take any land. Ben Gaviere, continuing that legacy, has explicitly called for an ethno-state where Arabs cannot vote. If anti-Semitism is consistently used as a club against every single human being that critiques the genocide that Israel is committing in Palestine, why the fuck are they unwilling or unable to call out the anti-Arab racism? Well, it's because the anti-Arab racism is what maintains and continues the Israeli project. If they view Arab people as human beings deserving of dignity and respect, they cannot justify having an ethno-state. If they see their security as just as important as Arab people's security, how the fuck can they justify doing an ethnic cleansing for their security? They can't. That is why institutions such as the ADL that consistently defend a vowed racist like Elon Musk, apartheid Barbie, just because they support Israel, will never be able to actually call out all bigotry, because their movement relies on bigotry. You cannot believe in an ethno-state for anyone without believing in some type of supremacy or bigotry. And in the case of Israel, it relies on a demeaning colonial view of Arabs and Palestinians that maintains the justification for the colony of Israel.",

We are not sending billions of dollars of weapons and aid to them So when they commit crimes It is not immediately and directly us that is complicit I would argue we still are but to a very different scale and level than we are in Israel So when I am an American citizen talking about American crimes Israel is first on that list because we are supporting them more than any other country in the world and then we talk about other things that we are Probably complicit in like sectarian violence in Syria So whenever you see these dipshits doing what about is them because they actually don't care about any of it Notice that number one they don't care about any of it so them saying you don't care enough is nonsense Two the issues are interconnected when we push against Israel We push against the destabilizing force that is helping maintain sectarian violence in the territory and three as with all what about is them The issues are different one is the largest recipient of American aid and one gets comparatively minimal American aid So America is much more complicit and thus we are much more interested in stopping one than the other You hush",

The ICC and ICC can take their fucking time, but actually the ICC has already ruled against serious treatment of their minorities. Ten years ago, you asked these questions as if you want an answer, but you don't because you obviously haven't even vaguely looked at it. These humanitarian organizations actually do their job in very diverse settings. And by the way, one of the most universal impediments to them doing their job is fucking Israel. Even back in apartheid South Africa days, Israel was the, by far, largest armor of apartheid South Africa, even following a UN embargo on South Africa, then America vaguely followed even. But you don't care. You don't care that Israel actually is a problem that actually needs to be addressed. You don't care that these organizations actually address humanitarian aid. You don't care.

And what I mean by that is real politics is what happens outside of the voting booth. The powers, the groups, the organizations that we build to influence what elected officials do. The left has learned this before. Unionists attacked all sides when unions were illegal. And you know what happened? Unions became legal. An abortion was illegal, pro-borsion activists did abortions and that pressure of the government into legalizing them. And the right has already learned this right wing organizations such as the Proud Boys and the KKK, organizations that did not start in electoralism but have clearly pushed every electoral right party to the right, including the Democrats. So it is infuriating for people that see this type of politics, people that understand that unions and community and mutual aid and direct action organizations are the things that will push any effective leftist change. It is infuriating for us to see that discussion, the importance of those things and the critiques that they bring to current elected officials being shut down because people think these elected officials are only chance. I understand the desperation. I understand how horrible Republicans are and I'm seeing their harm. The way we prevent that harm though is by building effective opposition, not bowing down to ineffective opposition. And AOC has joined that trade of ineffective opposition. So we should recognize her for what she is, she is a consequence of effective, progressive movements about seven years ago. And then we should move the fuck on, get what we can out of elected officials and start building the movements that will build the next generation of actually effective, not toothless elected officials. That is electoral politics, that's how electoral politics works. It doesn't work by being nice to the elected officials. It works by pressuring them into doing what they must.",

    "text": "Let's talk about the Druze Israel and Syria. The starting point should be that this regime in Syria was installed by America, Israel, and Turkey, and its allies. So further intervention from those groups is not going to solve the sectarian violence that are allegedly happening under this regime. And most Americans don't fucking know that. And that works to Israel's great advantage because their whole entire strategy is finding wedge groups in every single place around them and using them to justify intervention and further attacks. It is the same fucking playbook. So while we don't have complete reports, and I don't think it's helpful to report fully on this, I've no doubt that there is violence and ethnically motivated violence happening in this territory. But my fucking god, why do we trust the regime committing mass genocide against its own people to help that ethnic group? So suddenly Israel learns what genocide is, suddenly Israel learns what international law is, no, they're using this as a wedge issue. They are interested in a destabilized Middle East. If there is a destabilized Middle East, then they have a consistent enemy to justify consistently militarizing and consistently acting against the Palestinians and expanding their territory. That is what Israel and America did in Iraq. That is what we have done in Lebanon. That is what we did damn well in fucking Syria. Do not let them do this again. So I beg of you, if you're a leftist and you're inclined to just deny, deny, deny what Israel says, we have no reason to deny that the truth is being harmed in this place. But if you are anyone else and any other inclination, your response should be condemnation of Israel's illegal intervention into Syria. And let's be clear, that's what it is illegal. And it will be unhelpful. Further destabilization of the Syrian state, which is what Benjamin Netanyahu fucking wants will only harm every single person in Syria. Not actually protect them. Don't fucking fall for this again. We did it in Iraq, we did it in Lebanon, we did it in fucking Iran. Don't do it again. The way we protect minorities is not by empowering a genocide al-Ethno state. But it is rather getting our fucking imperialist armies out.",

Netanyahu knows that if he goes and answers a bunch of humanizing questions, he doesn't look like an evil war criminal on the fucking loose from the ICC. They asked this war criminal who was currently committing genocide against literally millions of Palestinians, what he preferred, McDonald's or Burger King. How the fuck do you sleep at night looking a war criminal in their face and not at the very least asking them, hey, how fucking dare you murder women and children? But just to be clear, the anger that everyone feels rightly at these two bumbling fools asking softball questions to a genocide heir should also be felt whenever people ask softball questions of the Democrats who are currently voting for this genocide. When people are asking softball questions of Kamala and of Joe Biden and, you know, of the Republicans who are obviously openly doing this, but they do get anger. We should be pissed. Joe Biden is a war criminal. Kamala Harris is a war criminal. Donald Trump is a war criminal. When you interview them, you should interview them as such. So this is not new. This is not surprising. It is just one of the peak examples of how normalized war criminals and genocide is in our society.",

But anyway, little nervous having his time in the sun today, but I want to remind you, he's just parroting what the other little weirdo, Curtis Yarvan, has said for like 20 years. This is Curtis Yarvan. You can see why the first guy empathizes with him. But he is funded by Peter Teal and he was so scared of saying these ideas out loud. Oh God, I wonder why that he published anonymously for like 20 years until he got exposed. So none of these ideas are new and they certainly aren't this guy's ideas. They're from Curtis Yarvan and other little losers online who are literally existing to make weirdos feel special and you feel really special when you get to decide what the autocracy is. You feel really special when you think your religion is the best one, but you don't even follow your fucking religion. The highest thing a Catholic should do is listen to the fucking Pope and y'all don't listen to the fucking Pope. You don't mean this. You just want a friend. The best thing we can do to these guys is just fucking ignore them. Ignore them and work against them. Ignore them as people work against them as political opponents because you're not going to debate with this guy. He doesn't give a fuck what he believes as long as it gives him a little fucking feeling of being better than everyone, which my god left to see y'allitarianism cannot do.",

    "text": "AOC is hiding behind some technicalities to defend why she is complicit in the genocide of Israel. Let's break down really quickly what's happening. He voted against a amendment to a bill that she ended up not voting for, but the amendment would make it such that the bill, if it was passed, would cut off defensive iron dome capabilities for Israel. And here she's clarifying that she didn't vote for military funding. The issue here, AOC, is that's not the point. You did vote for military funding previously, you have. In this context, you ended up voting against the whole bill, but when you were given an opportunity to specify that you never wanted any, even if the bill passed money to go to Israel for any reason, you were given an opportunity and you said no. And the reasoning you said no is bad. As one of my mutuals pointed out, you could have just said, I'm not going to vote with an anti-Samite Marjorie Taylor Greene on a Israel bill because she believes in ending Israel because she wants the rapture and I don't want that. That's a good take. This is a bad take. That is because there is no such thing as a defensive funding of an Israeli genocidal ethno state. You do know funds to it if it is committing a genocide that is your international obligation. And so I ask you, AOC, if you really believe in defensive capabilities being funded by America or at the very least, them not being cut off because that's what you actually voted against. Why are you not adding an amendment that would fund the defensive capabilities of Palestine, of Gaza, of Hamas? Why would you not do that? Are they not innocent children? Are they're not innocent children there that would be defended? No, you're not doing that because you realize that defensive infrastructure is part of a whole entire system that protects and enables and is complicit in the actions and crimes of the ruling regime. So when you say that funding the defensive iron dome capabilities is not what you believe in, you are being complicit in the thing you think is a genocide, apparently. And you're just admitting you're willing to be complicit. It doesn't matter if you didn't vote for the actual thing. You were given an opportunity to clarify you would never want to be complicit and you didn't take it. Just to be very clear, this isn't an AOC bad post. She did this because electoral politics are fucked on this point. The American Empire and the American electoral system is almost never going to vote against itself, its own imperial aims. We must build power outside of it to force it to. But we cannot rely on the people within it to force it to. They have no means by which to do so. So yeah, AOC bad for doing this whatever. But more importantly, system bad for forcing this to happen. So let's fucking change it.",

    "text": "Literally everyone knows that this humanitarian city would be a concentration camp. And before Israel says that that's deeply offensive because of the history of that term, I want to remind them of the history of that term. As it originates from the Spanish and Cuban war, was used by the British well before the Germans used it. What it explicitly is is the internment of political prisoners or specific ethnic groups for national security, exploitation, or punishment. Specifically in the Spanish Cuban war, what they did is they took all the civilians and put them in one place so that they couldn't help the rebels. That is verbatim. What Israel is saying it's doing in Gaza? They are saying Hamas is everywhere. Every citizen is helping in Hamas. So we need to put them in one place so that we can give them the meager amount of food we're going to give them. And we can be sure they're not helping the resistance. You can say that that's justified. You can say that they need to do it. But don't you dare say it's not a fucking concentration camp. It's exactly what the British said they were doing in the war wars. It's exactly what the Spanish said they were doing in the Cuban wars. It's not to say any of these things are exactly the same, right? But what it is to say that the justifications is real giving. Clearly match concentration camp. Clearly. And it is important to remember this history because the first move by any Zionist apologists will say it's not a concentration camp because they're not putting them in there to kill them. But that's not what a concentration camp is. There's a difference between a death camp like the German said it up in Auschwitz and Dachau and a concentration camp which the Germans also set up but so did the British show to the Spanish etc. And if we push past that conversation and you look at what the Spanish said they were doing in Cuba. If you look at what the British said they were doing in the war wars, it looks the same. Not only does it physically, not only can you look at the city and go that's a concentration camp but the reasons they're giving are the same. There is no hiding behind this. The only next move Israeli has is justifying it. You have to justify a concentration camp. But do that with your full fucking chest. Let's not play this game.",

But when I say leftist and liberal, what I mean is a leftist is a person that wants to abolish capitalism and a liberal is a person coming out of Keynesian or neo-liberal thought. That is because they are either a classical liberal or neo-liberal. This isn't perfectly coherent with the historical narrative, and it certainly isn't perfectly coherent in modern politics. But that's what we're talking about. We generally divide people into their political traditions and these are the clear political traditions in America. And there is a decisive, different political tradition between people like anarchist, socialist, communist, Marxist, Leninist, etc. and Democrats. These are different people with different ideas. So once again, they aren't the exact same thing, but we're talking in abstractions and generalities. But that's the only way we can talk when we're trying to understand what's going on in politics. If you aren't interested in learning this, don't learn it. But don't shit post when you don't know what you're talking about.",

So when left is talk about mutual aid or community building or direct action, like this is at least some of what we mean. Having five homies that you can dip in and out of a job fair to stand in front of ice or the department of defense or the department of state and prevent them from having that one day of recruiting, you literally cost them the wages of those people and it cost you nothing. And it's fucking fun, right? Like you kind of get stared at, you kind of get looked at, you get judged, maybe some people get mad at you and you get to bicker, right? Like it's scary sometimes you can face oppression but some of the lower level things, especially if you're a somewhat privileged person, can not only be fun but also build a really good community around you to do other higher level direct actions. And as fascism kind of increases in America as it has been for the past 40 years, right? This oppression level is going to go up and up and up and any teeny impediment that we can put in the fascist way of getting new recruits into their cult fucking following of ice or promoting their propaganda in schools or in job fairs or in universities is good and it pays dividends. So don't be scared by these big names, a lot of it is just showing up and doing basic shit. Stand in front of them, tell people to go to the next booth, tell people that they're, I don't know, sick. And if administrators tell you to leave, leave or don't, I mean that's your choice. And if you're made to leave, another person just magically shows up.",

Just like the guy at Glasstonbury thought ending the IDF was justified. You don't believe this. Obviously your whole entire page is justifying the death of people. You just think it's justified. Right? You obviously don't think calling for the death of people is unjustified because that's what supporting a military is. You're not chanting it. They're doing it. One second, you say something a little more ridiculous as well. With it, you cannot know when it's a different race, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. We... What are the IDF's pronouns, brother? Since when was the IDF a race or a religion? I thought it was a multi-ethnic army. That's what I was told by the Zionists. Actually, the people that you have yet to condemn, which are the people on Jerusalem Day chanting debt to Arabs, are actually calling for the death to an ethnicity. But IDF, not an ethnicity, brother. So not a double standard. The only issue here is if you think chanting death to a certain ethnicity is wrong, you have failed that standard. I haven't. And he certainly didn't. Not only is this stupid, it's fucking dangerous. When he conflates the IDF, a colonial army that pretty undoubtedly has committed widespread war crimes, even according to him, surely, with a race or ethnicity, which obviously he means Jewish people. You are giving Jewish people responsibility for their actions. You are conflating their responsibility and their actions. And that is fucking dangerous for Jewish people. That is actually fucking anti-Semitic, because that puts Jewish people in danger, because when people critique the IDF and you say that's critiquing all Jewish people, at some point they're going to say, okay, if that's what I have to do, it's nasty, but that's what happens. We've seen it. Stop! Second of all, calling it thuggish, calling it animalistic, calling it uncivilized is just fucking racist. Right? It's a black man yelling in support of Arabs. My god, I don't know how you could yell out more obviously racially coded attacks than that. A minor point because obviously everything you're saying is shitty, but let's continue to be aware of this because it is nasty. Calling a black man advocating against a genocidal terrorist organization, thuggish, or bistile, or uncivilized is racist. That itself is uncivilized. So you don't believe what you're saying.

So the Jizm goes, most Jews as Zionists, DEI disagrees with Zionism, therefore it excludes Jews. Oh my friend, DEI disagrees with racism, most white people are racist. Does DEI exclude white people? And if you're gonna deny that most people are white, or even that the identity of whiteness is inherently related to racism, I'm gonna have to ask you to check what the fuck you're talking about with DEI. That's one of its founding tenants. So back to this nonsense. Obviously not. What's going on here then? They're conflating a religious identity, which is a protected class in like this wokeism ideology they're kind of pointing to. And a political identity, which is most certainly not a protected class, regardless of the political identity, right? No political identity is protected class. Socialists, communists, Republican, Democrat, all of them are fair game to critique and attack. Religious identities though, are not Christian Muslim, Baha'i, etc. That is the whole point. That's the whole point of having protected classes in this kind of wokeism they're pointing to. To separate out immutable personal characteristics and political ideologies, that the whole purpose is to critique and attack. That's what DEI was made of, right? Like critical race theory is a critical theory of all of this discussion. And here's where we get to the danger. If we accept what they're saying to be true, which is that Zionism and Judaism are inherently linked, it must also be true that Judaism is inherently political in that way. And if it is inherently political, this ideology they are attempting to include themselves in, would itself say that it is then subject to critique? That would mean it ceases to be a protected category. The more we believe that any given immutable characteristic, white, black, Latino, Jewish, Christian, Muslim, is inherently related to a political ideology, the less we can set those aside when having political discussions. That's fucking dangerous. To just end this, true inclusion means accepting Jews fully without conditions. We accept them quaw being Jewish. Just as we accept Christians quaw being Christian, we accept Muslims quaw being Muslim, we accept white people quaw being white, but we don't accept white people quaw white supremacy. Muslims quaw being members of al-Qaeda, Christians quaw being members of KKK. Because those are political ideologies that are related to the underlying personal ideology. Just as Zionism is, we don't have to accept the political ideology that you think is related to the personal ideology. Because the whole entire point of the thing you're trying to be included in is to separate those out. So when we're attacking the political ideology, which we must in a civil society be able to do, we don't end up attacking the personal. But you are giving up those defenses to defend the political. And that's fucking dangerous.",

This is so idiotic, but it is this delusion amongst Zionists that somehow all Arabs should go to the Arabian Peninsula as if all of those Arabs aren't descendant of the exact same people that other groups in that territory would be. Because for the vast majority of Arab rule, Arabs were not a majority. They were a minority. And they didn't do the level of ethnic cleansing genocide and ethnic replacement that a lot of white colonialists did. Such that people that now identify as Arab are often highly intermixed with multiple groups. So this myth that all Palestinians are just Arabs that invaded forever ago is a lie. In fact, a lot of Palestinians, we have genetic evidence for this, are either Jewish people that converted into Islam, right? Or the exact same compositional makeup as modern day Jewish people are as it relates to ancient Canaanites. If this is Jewish people's homeland, it is also Palestinian's homeland. And if you want to say, well, their culture doesn't call back to the history. Number one, who gives a fuck? Number two, yes, it does. Palestinians have traditions directly related to the land that they live on. Nothing excuses ethnic cleansing. But if you were to try and excuse it because somehow Jewish people are more indigenous than Palestinians, you would just simply be wrong.",

But if you bring on a person that supports the fascist regime currently in occupied Palestine, you are not fighting fascism, you are wanting to replace one fascist with another. Or worse, you don't give a fuck, right? Like, or worse, you don't care. But if this is about fighting against fascism, that doesn't stop at the American borders, right? Because fascism doesn't stop at the borders of the nation. It's inhibiting. You find it all the way. And you don't platform people that literally support mass genocide of Palestinians, which is what he's doing when he is defending the genocidal state of Israel. Boycott this event. Stop defending it. The previous allegations we can have this discussion. But my god, how can you support an organization that is platforming a guy that literally told war criminals to hide their crimes better so he would have an easier chance of defending them?",

I actually have some mutuals going on as well and please for the love of God, leave this tour and boycott it. Destiny told IDF soldiers to hide their war crimes better. He is aiding and abetting a genocidal ethno state and you cannot separate these two things supporting the fascists in Israel who literally trained the fascists coming back to America. You cannot challenge Charlie Kirk in his fascist worldview while supporting it outside of America. You are supporting the structures that Charlie Kirk built his whole career off of while cause playing resistance. Please, this is not helping, it is harming. Destiny should not be platformed by anyone claiming to be a leftist and if you are a leftist going and speaking or representing an event that is headlined by him is supporting those very structures. This is classic fucking resistance live shit. They don't see that the struggle in Palestine is interconnected inherently into the alt-right in America and so they end up creating the very thing they claim to be resisting. This is disgusting. Do not platform this man. Do not work with this man and for the love of God do not be at an event co-headlined by him. Also, don't invite a fucking anti-sionist to co-headline with him. You dumb fucks. Why would you invite me? I said no, by the way.",

    "text": "Here's your monthly reminder that one of the most radical things the Black Panthers did was not just community self-defense, but Fed children. And those radical programs of giving free lunch to children is one of the main reasons the federal government was effectively forced into giving free lunch to children through a central program. Despite for the past 15 years actively undermining this program and the Black Panthers dared to give food to children. At one point before a delivery of this food the Fed invaded and pissed on all of the food they were going to give to children. And of course along with that murdered many many Black Panthers including people like Fred Hampton. When we say that change doesn't just happen at the ballot box, this is what we mean. There is a reason the federal government spent millions subjugating and undermining this very program and it wasn't health standards. It was because radical black activists having access to a large community and building genuine solidarity across coalitions fundamentally threatens the coalition that the American government is built off, which is the corporations and oligarchs. So if you're ever feeling down my friends just remember there was once a Fed whose job it was to piss on food that starving children going to eat because it threatened his oligarchy. Your life cannot be sadder than that.",

And that is a guy that has consistently act as an apologist for the Israeli genocidal ethno state. And you know how I know this? Because they fucking invited me and gave me all the details. Being diplomatic, I gave a pretty milk toast response, you can read it here. I think I kind of tore, but you do you? They chose to leave me on red. So let me make my position super clear. No leftist ever should work with a Zionist, and certainly not a Zionist and a organization that refuses to apologize and remand racism, which they were in their previous iteration. If you work with this organization, you are not helping any cause vaguely opposed to Charlie Kirk. In fact, you are supporting the very structures that built that fascist. And I don't fucking want to hear about effective political organizing. Number one, when they were dumb enough to invite me to headline with a genocidal maniac like destiny. And number two, we're not gonna win over the fucking pro genocide block. We're only supporting the dipshits that are doing this genocide. So let me make my position super clear out in public. Don't fucking go to this. Condemn it. Don't support creators that go to it. Condemn them. Unless they are literally going to starve without the money or clout that this super pack will pay you, do not go and expect everyone you know not to go. I was nice in this message, I think, because I thought I could get a little bit of response, but they left me on a red. So now let's just be super clear and honest. This is harming any progressive or effective political movement in America and is supporting the very superstructures that Charlie Kirk was built off. If you are anti-fascist, if you want to work against these dirty fucking fascists, you don't support fascists in Israel. And you sure as hell aren't racist about it. And just for a little bit of joy, I want to remind you, they texted me a person who's like, 70% of their platform is shitting on Israel to join an event headlined by an apologist for the Israeli government. If they want to talk down to us about how we're not gonna get anything done, maybe they should put two fucking neurons into how to organize an event and invite people that would ever work together. So please, don't talk down to me, get your shit together and come the fuck back.",

    "text": "Fine, let's talk about electoralism on the left. Because currently, everyone is eating each other up about this. So please send this to liberals yelling at leftists, saying they don't understand the electoral system, and leftists saying liberals are genocidal baby killers. I don't think both sides are equal. I think the leftists tend to be more right. But let's try and explain where this gap is coming from. From my view, the basic misunderstanding is liberals see elections first, and then every other action is a perfelist of that, and leftists see a lot of other actions affecting elections as a symptom. Things like unions, collective action, direct action, mutual aid, community building, all of these things are the leftist bread and butter, and very superfluous to liberals. And when leftists talk about electoralism, they are talking about the electoralism in the context of all those other actions, and especially how those other actions can affect electoralism and the elected officials can affect those actions. That's the conversation. Whereas, forgive me if I'm wrong, like this is a mass generalization, liberals primary fundamental ideology focuses on the civil society, things like nonprofits, things like voting, things like engaging with the government. But historically, leftists have been completely expelled from that because they were murdered by that. There wasn't a widespread CIA plot to murder liberals from the 70s to the 80s. There was of leftists. So I think what's happened here is liberals actually can use the civil society that exists to engage with politics. Leftists have been expelled from it, develop different strategies, and think those strategies are better. I happen to agree that those strategies are better. Does that mean I'm not going to vote? No, I did vote for Kamala Harris because I think electoralism is a strategy amongst others. So that's where I think the liberals are all in critiquing the left. We have a lot of strategies, and when we say voting's not that important, it's because we think there are a lot of other strategies that are and think they're all interrelated, and historically we've been right. Liberals and Republicans have murdered us. Liberals and Republicans have shot at unionists. You know, it makes a difference to people's day-to-day life, but collective organizing has been shunned by all of them, co-entail pro-killed all of them under Republicans and Democrats alike. Now, where the leftists are attacking, and maybe there's a miscommunication here, at least from my view, once again, is when we call you genocidal baby killers, right? It is because you condemn us when we say Kamala's a genocidal baby killer. She is. She supports Israel who is murdering children. So when leftists vote for Kamala, which a lot of us did, myself included, we are voting for her tactically, but vehemently hater. Liberals seem to think that when we critique her, right, that is the same as saying, there is no tactical benefit in voting for her. And actually, a lot of the people that said, there is no tactical benefit in voting for her, did that very contextually, fourth-third parties because they weren't in swing states. Now, there were some that said it was fundamentally immoral to engage in the electoral process because it is the current American empire. I think that's untactical, but that is a entirely different discussion.",

I actually think they spent the last two years brow-beating everyone into calling for that with them. The moral grandstanding coming from Zionist trying to say, oh, it's only the radical extremists that call for similar chance. No, call for death to the IDF is the same as death to Hamas. They are both internationally recognized terrorist organizations, just because the West doesn't recognize the IDF as a terror organization. Doesn't mean that it's not. And later in this, you conflate calls for the death of the IDF with death for Jewish people or Israelis, which is wild because the very discussion we're having is the comparison to death to Arabs, which is actually what is chanted habitually at terrorist marches that are sponsored by your government in Jerusalem. And I don't know a single mainstream pro-Palestinian person that wouldn't condemn chance that we're actually called for death of Jewish people or Israelis. That's not what they're doing. You have to go searching for it in other chants because we say other things because we don't want that. But also the difference between the chance as well between, for example, call for the death of IDF and call for death of Hamas is that Hamas wanted exist without the IDF. Hamas is inherently a reaction to Israeli colonialism, imperialism, and oppression, whereas the IDF was founded as a terror organization specifically to colonize and oppress the Palestinian people. So if you want to make moral distinctions, it's not going to come out in your favor.",

    "text": "Hi, I condemn Hamas and call for their abolition. Now what? Whenever you call out these rally occupations terror regime, you always get this. What about the end of Hamas? But okay, let's play along. Let's pretend they're morally equivalent. If we want the end to both of them, what do we do? Because Hamas has already registered terrorist organization, its leaders are already being investigated by the ICC. The international community has already publicly and openly condemned it through security council resolutions. Israel on the other hand is in active trade, training and armament with Europe, the UK and the US despite international courts telling them not to. Not a single security council resolution has been passed against Israel on this matter for the past 30 years because America, the world power has stopped it. Whereas Hamas is actively targeted and killed by almost every western nation. So these questions are always so inane. As an American citizen, I'm not arming Hamas. I'm not funding Hamas. I'm not training our ice-kissed oppose with Hamas. We're doing all those things with Israel. So if even if you think they're morally equivalent, it is self-evident that if you are an American or a westerner, your focus should always be on removing those aims and at least equalizing the actions we're taking against the Israeli terror regime and Hamas. But of course, they're not morally equivalent because Hamas remind you was literally funded by, you guessed it, Israel and continued to under Benjamin Netanyahu up until 2019. So if you want to end Hamas, the quickest road is to abolish the Israeli occupation. But no one in these comment sections are ready for that conversation because they don't actually care about Hamas. They care about maintaining an excuse in their minds for the abject violence that Israel has placed against the Palestinian people. It's never about abolishing the terror organization. For God's sake, Israel's funding new terrorist organizations in Gaza right now. It's about maintaining justification for war, which funds Americans' pockets and allows Americans civilians to feel better about the abject genocide going on by our henchmen in Israel. And a final note, it is illegal where I live and where a lot of people live to commend Hamas and say you support them. And I just want you to be very clear how much more interesting life gets, how much better your political analysis gets when you think thoughts that it's illegal to say. Because there's reasons they are illegal to say, it's not always because they're so harmful.",

    "text": "F**k you, get this, get to the IVA! Get that, get that! A beautiful chant. And if you think this is too extreme or so scary or warm-ungering or not helpful, I wonder what you think of Rockies here when we chant USA or Afghanistan here when they play Royal Patania. Because I'm pretty damn sure that what a lot of imperialized places here when we do chants like that is a throwback to when our countries, America and the UK, slaughter thousands of their civilians. So are those the extremist chants? Because this just sounds like we're calling for the end of a terrorist organization, the idea. And you may say, well, you're being extremists, they're not terrorist organization, they were literally founded by three terrorist organizations, the Leahy Irgun in Haganah. And I don't know how long you have to go without slaughtering a child to stop being a terrorist organization, but the idea has slaughtered a child every single year since they were internationally recognized as terrorist organization under the Irgun Leahy in Haganah. So they certainly haven't matured out of it. So no, I mean, the outrage and moralism and liberal angst that this is causing is not because it's calling for death. I mean, liberals have never been above that. They danced on the agraves of Iraqis and Afghans when it was in the benefit of America. That's the difference. The difference is this scares the American Empire because Israel's an outpost of it, whereas those deaths were, you know, just doing business for the American Empire. I'm not suggesting we call for violence and I can't. It's illegal where I live. And if you're going to have moral outrage, which you do have the freedom to choose not to do, the moral outrage should be towards the American Empire, the genocide of war-mongering American empire in its proxies, rather than to people calling for an end to the foot soldiers of that empire. And if you are pushing your moral outrage selectively at people calling for self-defense against these terrorists that America and the UK and Europe are funding, then you are missing the point entirely.",

And if they didn't get murdered, they got co-opted as we are literally seeing with the current labor unions in America. So I actually agree we should unionize, but we need multiple fronts if we're going to effectively respond to an undermined fascism. One of them certainly is the workers being organized. But that organization also has to have the backbone when the violence of the state comes down on them. And that involves not only arming and training people, but also preparing them, having people medically trained, having people prepared to take them in. And being sufficiently ideologically aligned, such that when it comes time to resist the inevitable fascist crackdown on any unionization, as every single fascist organization ever has cracked down upon them, we can actually mobilize those resources to respond to it. Unions are fine and do threaten fascism, that is true. But there were unions in Vimer Republic. They were the first ones cracked down upon. That is because unions alone are brife to be co-opted by fascists or liberals. And if they aren't co-opted, are very easy to destroy with a minimal amount of state violence. So this isn't a discrepaniment more of a guess-and. We need unions and arms and medics. And ideology and houses and support and community. Because they have all of it. So do we.",

    "text": "The Supreme Court just ruled that parents have a right to opt their children out of things that are oppositional to their religion effectively. And this UU has a damn good idea. To call up the principal of your child's school and let them know that if the tin commandments are on the wall of a classroom as the Texas ledge has just made it. Yup. Christians always forget that this religious protection thing goes both ways. If you want special rights, every other religion gets special rights too. I'm Unitarian. And for those of you who don't know, Unitarianism is a very amorphous but generally a really liberal religion. And one of the things that it is against, or one of the things it's for, is for a free and open search for truth in meaning. And if you are indoctrinated into religion, like Texas has required their public schools to do, that goes against it. That means that, as she said, the tin commandments is oppositional to the Unitarian Universalist faith and fundamental beliefs. So let's take this a little bit further. Also part of that is diversity or accurate, free search of truth and knowledge. Is teaching that the Confederacy was about states' rights when, in fact, it was about slavery oppositional to diversity and equity, which is a core tenet of my religion, as well as a free honest search for truth and knowledge? It most certainly is. Can I, my child, out of all history education or only the ones that you're teaching wrong? But if the conservatives think that their version of history is oppositional to their religion, did they opt out or do I opt out? Who doesn't get education? The Christian kids, the Unitarian kids. What about the Muslim kids? What about the Jewish kids? What about the Quakers who don't believe that any violence should be taught in schools because that's against their belief? The obvious issue with this is not that religions should be protected, but it is that it necessarily leads to a prioritization of religions. And the Christians are right on this bluff. They will typically win. But while they are fighting for this, we can use it against them. And as long as we don't simply become a clearly openly obviously Christian nation, this should work. Unitarians, once again, who have a pretty open and quite amorphous religion, could claim against almost anything at schoolteaches. So when it is beneficial, you most certainly could. And as a final note, Unitarianism is an open tent. Almost anyone can claim to be Unitarian and there is really no way that you could claim otherwise. So if you want to do this, just start saying you're you, you, and start causing trouble.",

As Trump calls more and more people terrorists, take note because that means what they are doing is scaring him. So as we try to learn how to resist more and more fascism in America, we need to remember the American Empire as well as the West made up this term terrorist to label any effective political opposition that dared use a fraction of the force that the American Empire and Co would use against them. It is not an insult, it is a compliment. But it also happens to have a massive security apparatus around it, with anti-terrorism labels being used to deny right about any civil liberty to innocent civilians that are slapped with it. Being denied banks, being denied entry at TSA, almost anything can be done to you if you are labeled a terrorist even more than if you are a criminal of other states. That is because once again, what they do scares the Empire, not because they are actually more dangerous than the Empire.",

    "text": "The Supreme Court case's birthright citizenship case is actually significant because it neuters the courts. It severely limits the ability of federal judges, right? So that is at the national level, judges, from doing national level injunctions, which means that an executive action can take immediate effect across the whole nation. But in order to get the injunction against it, you have to go to every single state and territory. That means that Trump needs to act once. And people responding to Trump need to act 57 times. And this has nothing to do with whether Trump's actions are illegal or not. This is literally being able to prevent them from being acted upon without judicial oversight, which is the whole entire point of three co-equal pieces of government. And it's really important that we recognize both how important this is and recognize how this is talked about. Because this does effectively neuter the judiciary. It is an inferior, if completely decimated part of America's government. If a federal judge cannot prevent the Trump administration who is equal to them, by the way, from doing actions the federal judge at least preliminarily believes them to be illegal, it gives executive power a 57 times advantage when challenging or acting, because its actions will be taken as the standard and then the judges will need to go through every single territory. But even how we talk about this, right? You will hear consistently the misuse of federal judges' powers to do nationwide injunctions. Relying on you not realizing that that's their job, they are federal judges so their injunctions should be federal. So on the national level, why in the world would a federal judge who believes a action that is taken by the Trump administration that affects the whole country? Why would they only do an injunction for a particular state or for a particular territory? Obviously, their complainant is complaining against the executive action, so they limit the executive action. But Trump has successfully claimed this as a case of judicial overreach when it could be farther from the truth. So this is scary, but it kind of confirms what we're already seeing, which is the complete degradation of the American judicial integrity and independence aid in an abetted by Trump appointees on the Supreme Court. They're not going to save us. We're not going to be able to every single illegal action get in an injunction 57 times, it will cost too much, it will not happen, and he probably just won't follow it. They haven't completely killed the judiciary, but they're well on their way. We need to start acting now to prevent fascisms overreach, because the legal system, the liberal order, will not.",

He wants to send social workers to deal with people struggling with mental illness. THIS COMING! He wants the city to take over grocery stores, which is such an ass-in-eye lunatic insane He doesn't even vaguely attempt to justify why it's an ass-in-eye lunatic. He just says it is. And also, Zoran doesn't want to take over grocery stores. He wants to provide state-owned grocery stores, not for state ownership of all grocery stores in New York. By the way, he should. The final thing Charlie says is hilarious though. More than anything else though, he is resentment-driven candidate. This is coming from a man who supported Donald J. Trump, who said America was dying and being invaded, and if they didn't elect him, it would literally die and fall. Donald Trump is the most resentment-driven candidate ever seen. He is angry about everything. Black people being accepted in public society, he wants to get rid of DEI. He wants to get rid of trans people in public society. If anyone is resentment-driven, it is the populist right. What they mean by resentment-driven is the left is finally getting as angry as the right-wing has realized works. The right-wing is terrified of Zoran. Even though at most, he is probably a social Democrat. He calls himself a socialist, really a social Democrat. But they're terrified, not because his policies actually threaten them that much. They won't. They won't. They will find a way to dodge the tax. They're scared because of how effectively he mobilized the working class. That used to be the right-wingers game. That's how Trump got in office. If they can start doing that, if we can start mobilizing the working class to do more than just vote, to go help each other, to strike, to do rent strikes, to do labor strikes, to do dead strikes, that threatens their power. That threatens Charlie Kirk's donors. That's fucking dangerous. So good, Charlie. Be scared.",

    "text": "Did you know the amount spent on Kamala's losing campaign for president? Could have armed literally every single trans adult in America? No, no, I actually did the math. There are about 1.6 million transgender adults in America and Kamala spent roughly 2 billion on her campaign. That comes out to about 1,250 per person, which means we could literally buy a fully prepared AR-15 with that money for every trans person. And mind you, we lost. This 2 billion literally had zero impact. And the Kamala campaign knew they were going to lose. The second they started, every single polling internally showed that. So when leftists say that they are skeptical of electoralism, it's not chastising people for voting. Personally, I don't give a fuck. What we are saying is there are 10 million better ways that we could actually use our money time and resources to actually serve and protect our communities. And by the way, leftists aren't just pitching when they say this, they do this. There is an organization that literally arms gay and trans people. And that's just one example of the community organizations that leftists have built and supported to actually protect and serve and feed and build our communities. So while we inevitably get more and more big wins from social democrats, we need to remember that voting and electoralism is one strategy amongst many. And at that, it is a very defanged one. And this is not a negative pessimistic message. This is positive. Go vote if you want. I vote it. But there is so much more and effective and rewarding organizing to be done. Four leftists that really want to see change. And importantly, electoralism will always be a symptom of the power that we build behind it. So if you're excited by like the Zoran campaign, go out and go organize so we can have 10 more and we can force them to be socialists. Not just beg for them to be.",

For example, look at this video they posted of the rightfully expelled Prince of Iran. There's some regime doesn't want peace. The only way to reverse that process is for this regime to go along with the regime. So then a so called centrist building organization is spreading pro-shah propaganda suggesting that it's the Islamic regime not the western agitators that actually fired first, not wanting peace. And actively called for regime change. So here's their main one acting like there are two sides which side of they are we need to take nuance and fear out of this discussion and really engage with the facts. But then the actual posts they're making are literally fear mongering by a person with a vested interest in regime change because if they fall America will reinstall the shaw and place him as a monarch. So him the royal family would benefit but this is exactly what the so called builders or centrist do. They're not trying to engage with the actual real truth facts of the issue they're trying to unite the American populace for its imperial aims. They view the people that are too obvious about imperialism as the exact same as the people that oppose it. But these are not the same. One of the people doing the bad things and one of the people trying to prevent them from doing it and builders falls very strongly in this camp where they are spreading and actively advocating regime change. They also host vitriol exionists literally never have they hosted anyone from PLO, PA, actual people advocating Palestinian national self determination. They've condemned the Netanyahu government but not the Israeli genocide prior to that or the ongoing ethnic cleansing of Palestinians which makes their purpose very very clear to make the harsh edge of right-wing imperialism a little softer but not stop it from hitting.",

    "text": "Until 2025, it has been a constant attack from America and NATO to stop Iran from making a nuclear weapon. That's simply not true. Iran was voluntarily a signatory of the non-proliferation treaty for the past 40 years and has been compliant with it, unlike America and Israel, neither of whom have their nuclear assets under international inspection. One of whom is the only country to ever actually use the nuclear bomb. And in fact, one of the largest deterrence of Iran ever getting the nuclear bomb was the Iranian nuclear deal that we were in with them until the guy you voted for, Donald John fucking Trump pulled out of it in 2016. The goal you have to just flagrantly lie is incredible, but I'm not one of the voices that you put in to make it sound like you have friends you're talking to, so I can tell you what you're saying is flagrant and obvious bullshit. The reason Iran doesn't have a nuke is in spite of America and NATO's aggression, not because of it. And the worst thing we could conceivably do is give Iranians more and more assurance that we will invade them if they don't get a nuke. We're not invading Pakistan, we're not invading North Korea, we're bombing Iran. What's the difference between those? If you worry Iranian, what would your response be? Because if you knew anything about Iranian politics, which you obviously don't, because you referred to the Ayatollah as the president early in this video, if you knew anything, you would know there is a good push of Iranians that are represented in their government that do not want a nuclear weapon because they want to peacefully integrate into the non-proliferation of the world. But every single time America shows that they will for no reason continue to address upon Iran until they get a fucking nuclear weapon, of course more Iranians are going to do the natural leap in logic and say, fuck, we need a nuclear weapon. So let's not pretend this is anything other than America and Israel continuing to destabilize the Middle East for their own benefit. It is that and that it and you lie about the international report on this as well. They did not say Iran was close to getting a nuclear weapon. That is a flagrant lion and is a dangerous fucking lie. What they said was that they had more enriched uranium. They explicitly said there was no evidence they were explicitly using it to build a bomb. This is going to be a rock part two if you don't stop lying along with the rest of the right-wing fascists in America pretending to care about nuclear non-proliferation while pushing America further close to a brink of world war. This is dangerous. Tell the truth.",

    "text": "The left enabled the Islamic revolution in Iran. Sound familiar? Iran was a monarchy characterized by a push for modernization. You know who else enabled them? America. America sided with the Islamists over the Marxists because they didn't want it to go to the Soviets. And the monarchy was pushing for democratization, but you know who's pushing harder? Mozadegh, who was murdered by America. If you want to talk about Iranian history and you want to talk about the role that different groups had in Iran, it is irresponsible, especially when regime changes on the table to ignore that American imperial interests are the reason Iran is the way it is today. It is the reason, the pushback from the illegal murder of Mozadegh in Iran led to the Islamic revolution. Obviously, these people have no interest in the truth because it is in fact America that led to the Islamic revolution. It is in fact backlash to there, horrendous installed authoritarian regime of the Shah that led to the Islamic regime. It is the fact that they destroyed every chance that Iran had to abolish that monarchy, to establish a democracy. That's what led to this. And to suggest American intervention now is like solving a fucking beasting with a nuclear explosion. It's batshit crazy. But they're relying on you not knowing that history. So we need to learn it or we are doomed to repeat it.",

This is a legal, retaliatory strike on valid military targets against an agitating, illegally invading force. If you have any semblance of aims for international law or peace in this region, you should not be siding with America. You don't need to side with Iran, but being mad for the American Empire will only destabilize this region more. That is what America is counting on. Do you know how many foreign military bases Iran has? Three in its neighbors. Do you know how many America has? Over 125 countries. The American Empire is spread across the whole world. Iran is hitting a part of sovereign American territory as a retaliation to an illegal strike by Israel and America. So I'll say it again, unless you have family in that territory, you can be upset, you can be concerned because people dying is bad, but you should not be more sad about that strike than the strike that America did. If you do, you care more about American nationalism than you do peace, security, and international law in the region.",

It is also important to note that following American regime change wars, almost always everyone, including women's rights, get worse. Literally in Iran, America supported the Shah over Mosehdaq, even the Mosehdaq was a liberal democratic reformer. America currently supports sexist as fuck regimes, such as the Saudi Arabian regime, which is doing horrible shit to women. The Jordanian regime. America historically supported the Mujahideen. They supported the sexist as fuck, fascist contrast. America does not go to war for women. America uses women's rights as a reason to impose imperialistic wars that harm women. Don't fall for it.",

I mean, I don't think Israel is a right to exist. But Zoran does. He said that Israel has a right to exist, but with equal rights. Why are you also mad about him saying it has a right to exist as a country with equal rights? The question that was asked to him about 10 fucking times was whether he believed that it had a right to exist as a Jewish state. Are you admitting that that means that it doesn't have equal rights? Is that what angers you? Is that what is suicidal? Is believing that Israel should have equal rights suicidal to Jewish people? Is that what it is? Well, to Zionists that clearly is what it looks like. Just as to Rhodesians equal rights was suicidal for white people, apartheid South African, suicidal, also for white people. Because equality looks like a oppression to the privileged. And when you are supporting an apartheid state, and you are the beneficiary of that apartheid, of course equality looks like oppression to you. But it doesn't make it reality. And it certainly doesn't make it what he actually fucking said.",

So just as a little bit of anocuating, it might be helpful to brush up on a little bit of Iranian history. First of all, they have elections. And in this recent election, a reformer that pushed against the hijab laws that they will use to justify a regime change war I promise you, he was elected. America has been subverting Iranian democracy since 1930. They killed MozaDig who was a secular reformer who is wildly popular. He wanted a liberal democracy in Iran, but America murdered him along with the British because he nationalized the oil. America also supported against the communists, the Islamists in the Iranian Revolution. America intervention caused whatever mess they want to say they are now solving now.

    "text": "Let's just get this straight. Antiscientism is anti-semitism. Then is hatred of the RGC anti-persion hatred? Is anti-Lebanese sentiment any Christian hatred? No, because of people and their government and their colonial projects are different things. For example, if I don't believe in states at all, I don't support any states right to exist. How can I be a Zionist? Does believing in no states at all thinking that it's not right for states to exist? Does that make me anti-Semitic? Surely not? On even a more basic level, believing that if we are going to have states, they shouldn't be for one or another ethnicity. All ethnicity should have equal rights, acceptance, and recognition within them. That's antithetical to a Jewish state. Does that make me anti-Semitic? No, no, it doesn't. On the contrary, that belief is juxtaposed with the very beliefs that have been historically used to genocide ethnically cleanse and expel Jewish people from their homes. Ionism originating in the works of Theodore Herzl, Chain Viceman, and Co-Signed by Balfour is ethno-nationalism for Jewish people. That is how they envisioned it. They viewed it as a nation for-up and by Jewish people. Specifically, he was inspired by a theory called romantic nationalism, a creation of a romantic story to justify the national identity and thus national preservation of a certain group. This exact same romantic nationalism was used directly, I don't mean this hyperboleically, by the Italians, by the Germans contemporaneously. And the Germans specifically used it in juxtaposition of the Jews. They explicitly created a German narrative that was anti-Jewish. And this is not unique in history. Hundreds of times over were romantic nationalist stories used to expel minorities, oppressed minorities. Many of the times those minorities were Jewish people. How can it be true that that same ideology is used to free Jewish people? How can it be true that oppressing and disagreeing with that ideology is going to be itself oppressive to Jewish people? It can't be. The tools of our masters cannot free ourselves. It cannot be true. The same ideology that was used to oppress and still now calls the benefit of those who want to oppress Jews because many Zionists are deeply anti-Semitic, look at the evangelical Christians. It cannot be true that that ideology not only is going to free Jewish people, but it cannot be true that opposing that itself is anti-Semitic. I would suggest calling on it often is anti-Semitic. So no, Noah, I won't get the applause, but you can have it for me. Anti-Sionism is not anti-Semitism. In fact, a lot of what the Israeli state was founded on, the Israeli state was supported by, and the philosophical underpinnings of the very ideology, you are supporting Zionism. Our support, Zionism is anti-Semitic, either functionally or instrumentally.",

Couldn't quite bring yourself to say Israel was committing a genocide could you. But I also want to say, you are a Holocaust educator. What if we taught the Holocaust like this? You start the education of the Holocaust with, well some American soldiers and the war started getting uprising, they impugnedly killed civilians and that is bad and they are evil genocidal capitalists. And also the Nazis are committing some war crimes. The government of the current Third Reich is committing some war crimes just to be clear. I can't condemn the whole regime. No, not the whole entire Zionist entity, not the whole entire Third Reich. No, just just this government. And also the people that fought back against the concentration camp that I don't personally morally agree with, they're equally evil. No, of course that's not how you teach it. And they're not identical and I don't think they're the exact same thing. But I do think there is an important reason we recognize first and foremost Nazis bad. And then second, sometimes their victims acted poorly. For example, sometimes people who were in concentration camps were forced to work for the people in the concentration camps. Do we start by condemning the Jews that were forced to work there? No, because the story of oppressed and oppressor cannot be equivocated. It matters that Israel is colonizing Palestine. It matters that Hamas was created as a response to that colonialism, as a response to that imperialism. It matters that Hamas has a certain ideology. That is true. But it matters a whole lot more how that organization came about. And when we do not recognize that that came about from a totally unequal power dynamic, totally unequal historical background, totally unequal motivation and background, we refuse to understand it enough to actually solve it. This is censorism, this is liberalism and it's fucking disgusting.",

But oh wait, that's not the free speech you were talking about.

They do talk about things like Palestinian protesters being kicked out, but they haven't talked about the ICE raids, expelling protesters, deporting protesters. Not that. They do talk vaguely about some anti-ice protesters being censured. But you know what they focus on? A lot more anti-Christian bias. Allowing trans bigotry. And I think I know why. Because one of their major collaborators is this person named Barry Vice, who is a far right-wing Zionist anti-trans bigot. And they work with her directly. They work with fire, who also works with the free press. They have had colloquialms and conferences together. And this is maintaining a long history of right-wingers, Cosplaying as freedom-loving patriots, Cosplaying as centrist to just want to hear both sides. But then not being bothered by the obvious and atrocious civil rights violations of the current administration. Oh, their own collaborators. Believing in Israel's genocide is one of the largest civil rights violations you can do. Cos it's genocide. But that's not enough for you not to work with them. You don't care about free speech. You care about allowing bigotry. And just because you occasionally talk about some other free speech issues doesn't mean that what you're protecting is civil rights.

It comes from a Harvard study which showed correctly that 3.5% of people actively participating in peaceful protests will overrule over Jean. The issue is the examples they pulled from, or are they colored revolutions, failed or weren't peaceful. For example, they pulled from the people power movement in the Philippines, which number one had backing from external groups. Number two wasn't peaceful, they stormed the capital, and number three failed. Philippines became a dictatorship immediately following this. Then they pulled from this one, which was the Rose Revolution, funded by the CIA, failed because Georgia is now a proxy for Russia to some extent and has 13% of their territory taken over. And third wasn't peaceful, they stormed the capital again. So if you want to cite this number, you need to do one of three things. Get external national help, be not peaceful or fail, right? That's what we can learn from this. Not having liberals tell you that when a policeman comes after you should sit down, that's horrible advice. The language of the oppressed is violence. I cannot advocate or support violence, but what I can say is the snide-ass liberals condemning people who are forced to violence when they are defending themselves against a fascist authoritarian state are wrong and ineffective and enabling that fascism, not fighting it.",

They didn't strike them when Hezbollah was attacking. They struck them when they were in peace talks with America. Iran has been in line with its nuclear responsibilities for the past 50 years. Israel has not. If it is about nukes, Israel should be bombed. Not Iran. Iran submitted to independent investigation. They don't even have nukes.

    "text": "This is not the first time Israel's tried to cause a regional conflict to destabilize peace talks. Israel advocated the disastrous invasion of Iraq, of Afghanistan, of Syria that America engaged in. And this is not to say America didn't make that choice either. America massively profited from it as well. But it is always and has been always in the settler-colonial estate of Israel's aims to destabilize the region. Because as long as it is unstable, Israel has an excuse to commit its genocide. The second it is stable, the self-defense, the victimhood loses its bite. That is what they are doing so clearly with Iran. America and Iran were in peace talks because Trump, as very classic fascist, do is trying to receive the empire. Israel wants nothing to do with America receding its empire. That's not in its interests. So it is disrupting these peace talks. It has no interest in these peace talks. That is why it is trying to start not only possible the original conflict, but a world conflict. Considering now it seems the UK and US have at least in some part been involved. This is dangerous and this is colonialism. I don't care where you stand on this. If you think the hostages are more important than Palestinians' lives, you're not respectable. But even you should recognize that two nuclear armed world powers being pitted against each other by a colonial state is fucking dangerous for every living human being. Don't let it happen again.",

Bro, you need to make your Nazi shit sound even vaguely concerning. Because even if I was a white supremacist, even if I bought hook line and sinker, your neo-nazis shill shit.

Damn fucking right, but importantly, I want you to watch this video because he goes through beat by beat exactly what you'd think. He lies and then he's homophobic. Is it true? No. Did you know Israel is the only country in the Middle East where it's even legal to be gay? I don't think that's completely true. So she is correct. Turkey, it's obviously not illegal to be gay. Jordan, not illegal to be gay. Lebanon, not illegal to be gay, but there are anti-propaganda laws not great. None of the gay rights here are great. Israel famously black males Palestinian to a gay into working for them and risking their lives. But what they said is just patently false. And their disingenuity makes clear at the end. If you went to Gaza you would be thrown off a building map. And they're celebrating their fantasy of gay people being murdered. That's homophobic. It's also not true, right? Where the fuck do they think people are getting thrown off buildings? It's from like one video of the Taliban 10 years ago. But I want you to call that what it is. Tomophobia. This is so obviously trashy Zionist propaganda. But it is helpful to learn how they do it. Because this video doesn't make the other person look great. Even though the Zionist was lying flagrantly. The thing he said was flagrantly untrue. And he was trying to be the side of gay rights while being homophobic. And also not actually responding to what she said. He never said that liberation for Palestinians wasn't liberation for gay people. He just kind of asked if he supported Israel. And the reason we didn't see that clip fully from her is because he admitted. He thought it didn't make him look good. If this is the best they can produce, we're doing some shit right, y'all.

Oh, oh, where are those rainbow logos now? Oh my goodness, are those the same companies murdering gay people in Gaza? Are those the same companies being used to surveil gay and trans people in America? Yes, the fuck they are! So you are strictly correct. They do fund the protests if that's what you want to call the Pride merch stands that are in the middle of a city. And you are correct, some of them donate to some liberal organizations that provide some legal support for gay people. But they get that money from wage theft. They get that money from their workers and they engage in industries that are oppressing us. Most gay people aren't only oppressed because they're gay. They're also oppressed because they're fucking poor. And you know who's making people poor in America? Those corporations that are stealing the workers money to buy pride flags. I don't know how many times I have to reiterate this. There is no liberation in capitalism. If we rely on the structures of capitalism to liberate ourselves, our liberation will always come at the cost of someone else. And that is what we are seeing. And that is what we are seeing. Some gay men specifically are realizing that that is the situation. They get liberation. They get a little bit of privilege. In exchange, they sell out every other oppressed group. You want to work with corporations? You're not going to get the unions at your fucking pride. You want to work with corporations? What about those corporations murdering people in Gaza? Murdering people in Yemen? Murdering people in Sudan? Do you think other oppressed minorities who have family that were murdered will want to come to pride? What about those corporations that are surveilling are black and brown citizens in America? What about those that are deporting and helping ICE deport people? Do you think they're going to come to pride? No. No. So not only is it basically not helping white cis gay men anymore? Where are the pride logos? But their inclusion and especially their structural reliance in the queer movement has always been at the cost of solidarity with other people. So you're right. It does benefit some people. But at what cost and to what end?",

Who developed that technology? That's right, the IDF in Israel. The exact same state that you've been running apologetics for for the past year and a half. That same surveillance technology ice is now using with Palantir was used on Palestinians. The strategies developed in the West Bank are being used by ice. The IDF trained ice members. This is why liberals and alice will never be complete. Because inevitably the weapons, the tactics, the oppression that is used in the periphery of the empire always comes back to the core. And if you are unwilling, unable, or actively disinterested in undoing and condemning those harms when they're being developed, how the fuck will you be able to defend against them when they are developed and here? You won't. So it's great that liberals have suddenly realized that these weapons of oppression are harmful and unjustified and scary and authoritarian. But they will never be equipped to prevent them because they are fine with them being used over there. They can't even condemn those weapons of war when they were being used in their lifetime.",

Protests are much more fun when everyone wears a mask. Just for COVID of course, but if they're doing it, you should too. Protests? Much much more fun when you have a community surrounding you. So if we are gearing up for large-scale protests against ice, we need to be before those knowing who we're going with, getting community and groups together to support each other and knowing who you can trust.

They need your support, they need your eyes right now. This is not about the people on the boat. This is about Israel doing every single thing it possibly can to prevent aid, prevent basic necessities from going into Gaza. This is about Israel being willing to murder in cold blood activists for simply attempting to feed people in Gaza, for simply attempting to mildly lower the harms of genocide Israel is doing in Gaza. And if the world allows this Freedom Flotilla to fail, they are failing not only the people in Gaza, but every other victim of the imperialism wrought that Israel is. As a point to those people saying they should do it the right way, they tried those aid workers got murdered by Israel too. The international community is under an obligation to protect the Freedom Flotilla and the United Kingdom where I currently live is under an international obligation to protect it because they are flying their flag. If Israel attacks this Flotilla, it is an attack on the United Kingdom. But they might let it happen because they are complicit as well in this genocide.

For deading that Muslim groups can be different than each other, forgetting that the CIA and Israel has been caught multiple times in multiple cases, funding either al-Qaeda or Hamas, depending on where they are. This is not new. Hamas was funded in the 1980s by Israel, specifically to displace other Palestinian groups. And now this group, which was caught stealing aid a year ago, all accusations are confessions, are being funded and given weaponry directly by Israel now. If this is about beating terror, Israel is the terrorist. If this is about saving lives, Israel is the one costing them. And just to be clear, if this group does gain power, if this group does gain support, if this group does succeed, Israel will do the exact same thing they have done to Hamas and use them as an excuse to genocide Palestinians. So this is not a moment to arbitrate between Palestinian groups, but a moment to note that Israel will do everything it takes to commit the genocide against Palestinians. And we cannot accept any of their excuses. Because Israel has caught and caught again creating the crisis that it says it is merely responding to.",

Like most other people in the West and at this point most people in the world, Americans have a deep-seated racism and matched with our extraordinary normalized nationalism and patriotic ego when we are not socially barred from doing something which is very rare when we're not in America surrounded by the society we respect, we are going to put that racism on display. So while British people maybe would hide their racism a little bit because they're socialized to be quiet or not judged or do so in a very British way that doesn't read to other people, Americans because of the nature and openness of that culture are very open about our racism and very clear about it and very unabashed about it. And this is clear if you've ever seen Americans travel anywhere is of course not only do they not think they're below it, they also think they are better and will be quite open and honest about that. So I am a bit of an America abroad apologist. I think the Europeans are evil as well and actually are quite horrible culturally to people as well and shit on Americans a bit too much. But the idea that we're not you know thinking we're superior is nonsense. I've seen Americans think they're superior to everyone.

The same reason white supremacists make up myths like white genocide, which is by the way the same thing that Trump is doing with South Africa. Because they are seeing their superiority in law, in society, the way that they have oppressed everyone else, maybe going down, maybe being threatened, and to them it feels like oppression. They feel oppressed, and so they want to have a justification for reversing it, giving themselves more rights, returning to the position of superiority. And in order to do that, they need to believe that they are genuinely oppressed. So they live in fantasies like you saw before, where the Bible would be illegal in America. But this is seen in lesser forms, right? The idea that LGBTQIA plus rights is equivalent to destroying straight marriage. The idea that civil rights is equivalent to destroying the American way of life. Well, yeah, it is if the American way of life is racism. And so I think if you keep your eye out, you will notice this happen a lot. To those who are privileged, equality feels like oppression. And oftentimes they'll tell you that very explicitly by living in fantasies of oppression, because they want to feel, they want to validate their feelings as a victim so that they can turn that anger out on you.",

That's wrong. And I'm genuinely surprised you put these two things so close together because you are suggesting that freedom in this territory means genocide. When Israel's whole entire point is that they are freedom. They're a liberal democracy. But you've just admitted you realize they're not.

And if I am organizing with people that believe we should organize with cops, it is literally impossible to build that power. If I'm organizing with people that believe in capitalism, it is literally impossible to organize radical working class power. So the issue with compromising your principles when organizing is that it fundamentally undermines the goal of organizing. Liberals can't undermine fascism, they built it. So I agree. I mean, all work with Maoists, all work with anarchists, all work with, you know, Trotskis. But I won't work with the people that made fascists, right? So I think when liberals are centrist or people that think they're leftists but haven't really deconstructed a lot, here absolutism or very strong convicted leftists, they don't understand how convicted in their liberal principles there are. I'm very open to discussion. I'm very open to debating my points, my values, my goals. And I've changed my mind a lot. But we're so far apart and I recognize how far apart we are and you don't. So until you start, you know, not vomiting at the side of a Maoist, not crying at the side of a Stalinist, I'm not going to be the problem in a coalition. You will be.",

Yeah, I'm not very kind to you. I'm not very open-minded to your views. If you're on the side that literally slaughtered socialists in America, I don't think as a socialist myself, I should treat you with much human dignity. If you are on the side that literally sterilized thousands of gay people, yeah, I don't think I as a gay person, I'm gonna treat you with much dignity. Because the idea of open-mindedness or forward-thinkingness that you think you're deserving of from the left, is contingent upon reciprocity. And you using a soft tone isn't that. You thinking that I deserve fundamental human rights and acting on it is that. And what's happened in America is that the floor has fallen through the fucking crust of the earth. The floor of human decency is gone. The Democrats are below it. The Democrats are now turning their back on trans people. How the fuck are we meant to have a real debate with someone that doesn't think you should exist? I'm sorry, I don't think the point's very clear. Fuck you, centrist. I'm not open-minded. I'm open-minded to people that treat me with dignity and respect. You don't. So if his point is that leftists are rude to him because he's a centrist, if his point is that right-wingers are kinder to him because he's a centrist, then I think he's demonstrated very clear which side he's on. It ain't the left.",

    "text": "Why do I call RFK a fascist? Because he's working for a fissistic regime, and he has really weird obsessions with eugenics. RFK's commentary on autism is eugenical. His association with Trump is fascistic. His almost mythological understanding of nutrition and diet and health is very reminiscent of the truly weird things that old-time fascists believe. So when it quacks like a duck, and when it walks like a duck, I'm going to call it a fucking duck. And RFK quacks and walks a lot like a fucking fascist. And so does this whole administration. And I'm just a little tired of fighting with people online over what a fascist is, or whether Trump is one, without them having the most basic understanding of what fascists in the past believed. So yes, fascists are fucking weirdos. I beg of you to go and read any fascist literature from the past, like from the 1930s or 40s, and tell me that what they believe is not fundamentally very, very weird. They're obsessed with North's mythology. They're completely made up nation-building myth. Right? So North mythology was a lot of naughty shit, but nation-building was made up by the Italians, by the Spanish, by the Portuguese, by the French had fascists, the fucking famous that the Germans had fascists. All of them had really weird national beliefs. And I'm not calling them weird because I don't have weird beliefs. I'm calling them weird because they were so incredibly divorced from reality. And at least to my understanding, what I believe is pretty fucking close to reality. But the fascists pride themselves in being divorced from reality, living in mythos. It's literally called romantic nationalism from which it was built. So no, if we're going to have this discussion, I really think America needs to. We should know what fascism is, know the history of it, and be able to recognize it. Because if we do that, we will recognize America is becoming more and more and more fascistic every single day. And we are well-passed entering into a fascistic regime.",

    "text": "Trans has absolutely nothing to do with gay and I think that we really need to start talking about... Damn, it had a lot to do with gay when they were defending our rights. When they were fighting the cops with us. It seemed to have a lot to do with us when they were holding our hands on our death beds during the AIDS epidemic. That seemed to have a lot to do with us. Of course we know that's nonsense, but it's interesting to see why he's doing this. It's because he's a paid right-wing shill and the right-wing wants to break up the gay community. Why? Because we're fucking powerful. Gay men, by and large, have gotten privileged. Gay men, a lot of the time, have privileged in this society. There is a lot of acceptance that has happened within the past 20 years. And if we take the deal, if we leave behind the community that got us that privilege, that works so fucking hard to give it to us, not only do we become easier targets because we forget how we got this power. But then the rest of the community that still hasn't gotten privileged acceptance, openness, right-wingedness, they're left for dead. If we let dipshits like this convince us that being gay and being trans have nothing to do with each other, which is nonsense, obviously the thing they have to do with each other is that they're oppressed by dipshits like him, if we let him win though, both communities become more vulnerable. We are always more powerful together, and it is important to remember not only will we be powerful to protect ourselves, the queer community is powerful as is. That is a powerful force to fight fascism that is growing in America. And if it is broken up, we lose that bulwark against fascism, and we cannot afford that. Not now, not then.",

So whenever you find yourself saying that these type of actions will only incite further violence from fascists, I want you to remind yourself that you are doing their work for them, suggesting that their violence could ever be morally justified by actions of those resisting. So when organizing, when thinking about what actions to support or do yourself, yes, active risk management should be taken. That is true. But when discussing actions taken by others, suggesting that fascist backlash is ever a reason to not endorse or support it, will always be a mistake. Because it will only mean that fascists will be able to point to you and say, hey, look, they said it justified my actions and then do whatever they want. It is never true that a fascist actions is justified because they are a fucking fascist. So I want us just in the abstract to remember, endorsing actions in some cases can cause legal consequences and risk. Taking actions can also. But when we are talking about which ones to condemn, never ever ever is a fascist response of reason to condemn. Because a fascist response will come one reason or another, they will either make it or use you to justify it. And our goal should be to consistently remind every single person we conceivably can, there is no justification for further authoritarianism.",

    "text": "Watch Andy Bung some centrist mind-wrought. Here are three things that regressives have done to alienate people in the middle of the first- I just want to start when was the last time you saw a video about the right wing alienate people from the middle? Did the white supremacist marches in DC alienate the middle? And if not, are we really talking about the middle but continue? Using to say when progressive ideas were taught, so saying things like defund the police or abolish prisons and nobody on the left really speaks out against those crazy ideas? Yeah, so the first thing that progressives is being progressive. Thank you so much for that. So informative. And you once again didn't tell me why these things are bad. Why should we have slavery in America through prisons? Why should we have a funded, obviously authoritarian, sanding army through police? Why should we have those? These aren't critiques. They're just kind of vibes. Give me an actual argument and a respect your position. So yeah, no, this isn't a sin. You're just observing that progressives are progressive. Oh, also, are you fucking kidding me? Did you see the whole Kamala campaign where she talked out against every progressive idea? What? What's interesting here is I actually agree race essentialism on the left is a problem. But why would that push you to the right? If you see race essentialism and you go, oh, guys, the left is like being a little racist with like reducing everyone down to their race. Why would that push you to the right where your answer is just to be openly racist? Like, surely the answer is like, solve it within the left and like actually give a fuck about solving the issues. That like, lead people sometimes mistakenly to race essentialism. Rather than just being like, I don't care, I guess I'm the victim now. But this is the second thing about centrists. They are self-centered. It is about them, not others. If they feel like they're the victim, someone else has done something wrong. Rather than saying, hmm, maybe these guys are trying to actually solve a problem. And the right is the fucking problem. Uh, just find your downplaying with the OM riots. So when those riots happened, there were peaceful protesters, but there was also brain buildings. Yes, so I'll do this when any of you apologize for the Warney Rock, the War in Afghanistan, or the January 7th riot. I don't care, actually. And also the BLM riots, the vast majority of them were peaceful. Much, much, much, much, much more peaceful than the right wing. So I do actually think by definition we should downplay it because literally everyone in the media upplayed it so incredibly hard. Right, whereas they actively ignore the fact that the right commits the vast majority of domestic terrorist attacks in the country. I just want you to know what you did there as well, downplaying it. That assumes that there's like a correct level to reference it. Or the level that the media put on it was correct, which is wrong, right? It's just assuming that the center is correct, which is not correct. The center is wrong. The BLM riots were blown way out of proportion, and the right wing was blown way under proportion. Centris begged the question. They presume that their position is right and get mad when everyone else just disagrees without actually engaging with the content of their issues, which is why ultimately they become apologists for fascists.",

But that's not like Americans fault. The vast majority of us would love a better education system. It is the fact that we are a fucking oligarchy that is intent on propagandizing everyone that prevents us from having one. It's like, oh, look at these silly Americans. They're victims of the American oligarchy. Let's make fun of the victims. I don't know a single American that wouldn't want a better education system. At that, I don't know a single American that doesn't want some amount of gun reform. Like, the things that you make fun of us for, we agree, right? And like, there are some shithead Americans who are like anti-Universal Health Care, anti-gun reformation. But they're also victims of the propaganda that we were taught. And it is because of this shit education system that we get increases of fascism in America. And so when you make fun of Americans for this, maybe this is my nationalism. I don't love America, but I am still America. And I still have that built into me. Like, maybe this is me. But what's funny about it? You know, I get it. Americans especially when they come out saying stupid shit, it is funny. But consistently dunking on us. When this is a video about how I am talking about how our education failed us and you're like, ooh, how awkward. You didn't get taught this? Yeah, that's my point. And on that, by the way, I go to school in England. Some of the shit y'all believe is fucking crazy. I had never been around people that believed that England and the UK should continue occupying Ireland. Quite honestly, people that knew about the shit in Northern Ireland in America agreed with me. Then it is occupied. And then I come here and I believe, I meet people that believe in sane shit. The rise of fascism in England despite having a better education system. The insane racism in France despite having a better education system is quite honestly more embarrassing. So I'm not a big defender of America. But dunking on America is cheap. And while we're at it, y'all, if you're American and you're dunking on the south, it's also cheap. And high-key almost inevitably racist. Ultimately, this isn't me being like, America's great. Stop shitting on it. It's some of this shit is just like number one unfunny. Number two, kind of the point. You know, like I was dunking on the American education system and now we've made it like a joke. I don't know. And number three, like let's punch up guys. You know why we make fun of the French is because they think they're better than everyone. And so it's necessarily punching up for making fun of them on that.",

The Nuremberg laws, in part, were modeled off of American Jim Crow regulation. Now America was not the first or last to do racism, but it is incredibly important to remember that all of these people, all of these regimes, all of these abhorrent, disgusting ideologies that we are taught from a young age to hate and abhor were not unique, were not independent, and were not strange to this world, but were actually incredibly similar, incredibly related and natural conclusions of things that America had produced. And I've been talking about this a bit now. I think there is something seriously wrong about how we teach evil in our classrooms. We teach a lot of evil regimes, the apartheid South Africa regime, Rhodesia, the Nazis, the fascists in Italy, Mussolini, right? As if they are some new evil people that we must understand specifically how Mussolini was evil, how it was Hitler evil, how it was apartheid South Africa, how would those leaders evil? When we should be much more interested in what techniques did they use? What led to this type of consequence happening again and again and again and again and again? And most importantly, how are we seeing the same patterns come about today? Because I swear to God if you go back and watch some of these speeches, some of these arguments, some of these policies even they look damn too familiar. An American individualism, American ideas of great men throughout history have taught us that these are just individual problems where individual strong and individual powerful people, individual radical religions caused insane change, but that's not true. What happens was that systems of oppression came to their natural end and to their peak and we are seeing another local peak of those oppressions today in America and if we don't learn from those peaks in the past, we are doomed to repeat and build the systems of oppression that will lead to them again. So that's like a very long way of saying we need to fucking learn how these evil shit happened so it doesn't happen again and my calling back to always just because I know a lot about it is colonialism in Africa and fascism in Europe and they are infinitely related and now we are seeing the end, right, the tail end, hopefully, of colonialism by America and then imperialism going back to America in the form of fascism. It happens again and again and again and if we don't fucking learn from it, we're not going to stop it this time.",

    "text": "While we're on the topic of fascist propaganda, I want to remind people they don't need people to support them. They just need everyone that disagrees with them to be silent. Or when they are speaking, to be doing shit that doesn't matter. And let me just kind of flesh that out, because I think most people in their popular imagination think they would be the person that would need to be put on trial, kidnapped, and they would need to escape in the middle of the night. But with the vast majority of people, the only precondition for them not speaking is that speaking makes them seem uncool. Outside of their social group, unaccepted. And for inferness, the past 30 years in America, that issue has been Palestine. That issue unequivocally has been Palestine. If you spoke on Palestine, you could not get an elected official job. You could not really work for them. You were toxic politically. But in our previous generation, my parents generation, it was identifying as a communist. And that's not because either of those two things are inherently toxic ideologies. It is because if you were a communist, my parents generation, you were slapped with the label of supporting everything Fidel Castro ever did. Supporting everything Stalin ever did. And if you were a pro-Palestine today, they try and slap you with the label of supporting everything Hamas, Hezbollah. Iran have ever done. But that's obviously nonsense. If you're a Democrat, you're not slapped with the label of supporting everything Obama ever did. Everything Joe Biden ever did. And if you do, I think you're a despicable human being. And you should be ousted from politics. But that's not how political ideologies work. And that's obvious to anyone with critical thinking, but it is a fear tactic. And why? It's not because they actually think you support everything Fidel did. And it doesn't actually need to make sense. The answer is that if they can scare you into it, if they can make it so that everyone always, when they're interacting with you politically, have to consider if they're talking with a person that supports such and such atrocity, you'll just be quiet. You just won't take that step. You won't say what you may be believe. And also you'll start to believe maybe they're right. And maybe it's just easier to believe something else. And maybe okay, like this seems problematic, but maybe I'll just accept it because it's what everyone else thinks. And surely there's a good reason. And whenever I talk, people get mad at me. And that very quickly moves to supporting liberalism, which is totally inept and feckless at responding to fascism. Or tolerating fascism. Well, fascists seem to be going on well. Maybe I need a job. I mean, I have ideals, but like look, when I express my ideals, it looks like it causes problems. And I don't want to cause this other harm and everyone seems to be going here. So I'll just go with it easier. And that's propaganda. That's fascist propaganda. It's not always the nasty posters we see with caricatures that's openly racist. That's obvious, but that costs them a lot of political points. Making you silent and making it easier for them to just passively banali be evil? That's the hallmark.",

    "text": "Is it just me or were you also taught that the Nazis had really good propaganda, but never what that propaganda looked like? Because how I was taught about it was that the Nazis effectively were able to propagandaize and indoctrinate a whole entire nation into hating Jewish people and that it was because of their good propaganda, but I was never told what that looked like. And I think that's fucking dangerous because the anti-Semitic tropes that they use to justify harm back then are being used now. The anti-trans, the anti-queer, the anti-roma, even the anti-slavic tropes that they're using are still used today to do it. So for example, I'll speak on like my communities of like queer people. The trope of gay people and trans people being child groomers was explicitly used by the Nazis when talking about trans people. The idea that communists and socialists are terroristic agitators is literally what justified the enabling act following the Reichstag fire. The Nazis were not able to do what they did simply because they were a heinous, totally new type of evil. Don't get me wrong, they were fundamentally evil. They were able to do what they did though because they played the propaganda game. They looked for excuses, they looked for people to blame, and that looks like a lot of different ways. They made excuses, they have plausible demisability. When trying to gain the acceptance of German people of having concentration camps in their society, they had a model concentration camp that they showed the media that was much cleaner and nicer and better, obviously, than what actual concentration camps looked like. When people resisted, they stepped back. They were obsessed with maintaining popular support, and it is important to understand how they moved to build and maintain that popular support because modern day fascists will follow the same activities. I really fear the reason we were not taught in depth, how they actually did this, even though this type of propaganda is some of the most fundamental to countering fascism, is because our education system and our media and a lot of what our politics are based in are leveraging very similar propaganda techniques. This is not to say it's the same, but I do have it very difficult to distinguish between the type of propaganda that I was exposed to following 9-11 regarding Arabs and Muslims and things that I've seen from Mussolini or Salazar or Franco. The abjectification, the dehumanization of these people used to justify and completely ignore brutalization, expulsion, violation of their fundamental rights in Gitmo, all because they have a different culture or because people that looked like them did something bad or because some kind of confusing facts led to one of the leaders of one of their countries may be doing something that didn't quite follow international law. So it's really concerning that we weren't given the tools to undermine fascist propaganda.",

It's half of the places it's composed of, Punjab, Afghan, Kashmir, Siddh, and Baluchistan. You know why? Because it's not a real fucking country. You can move that. This used to be part of Pakistan. It's no Bangladesh. This used to be its own independent country, Sikheem. This was habitually denied a plebiscite to determine who ruled it. Pakistan is illegally occupying it, and India illegally claims it. China also has a claim over it. This is part of what they are fighting over right now. This was annexed by India, surprise, surprise. And I say this not because anyone is like an upmost evil in this. I think all of this is going to be consequences of material conditions. But I say this because if the West starts talking about this, as they seem to be starting to talk about, we must self-consciously be aware of the part that the West played previously in this place, which is absolutely and incredibly vigorously ramming it hard. We destroyed political independence, political ends, any independent homegrown political movements in this territory. And the consequences of that are still being fucking seen. I think it is incredibly important that we talk about the oppression that the Kashmiris are under, under a quite fascistic government in India, and reprehensible government in Pakistan. But if we are to do this, we must recognize the impure history of it, recognize the arbitrary boundaries that are now causing incredible violence in the territory that were drawn by our forefathers. Because if we don't, we risk repeating the harms of the past. Oh, also just for clarity, I don't think India is a real country either. I don't think the US is a real country. Like my commentary on Pakistan being a fake country is that it's just so recently made up that it's quite stark, but I don't mean that to undermine it compared to other states, which I also think are fake.",

The fact that they are the big dick in the territory, the people that have the most guns because America gives it to them, doesn't mean anything normatively. And if we're descriptively looking at it, I also joke really care. I can observe that they're using their state powers to oppress people. I can observe that they think they have laws. How does that affect what I should think of them? The fact they're a state actually has very little to do with my view of them, other than to observe that as they are a state and think they are a state, they have obligations under international law, which they are not following.

And it is a good time to remember that the same people that did this nonsense, as well as that nonsense, did this, this, and failed losers at this. And I don't expect you to know the history of every single one of those places. But if you recognize that the colonizers and imperialists have very common aims, intentions, goals, and functions in those territories, it will make undoing the fascist rhetoric that comes out when these things do heat up much easier. The fascist rhetoric we are seeing from Prime Minister Modi in India is almost indistinguishable. From the fascistic rhetoric we are seeing from Smotridge out of Israel. If you have recently been brought into a cause working for Palestinian liberation, working for Kashmiri liberation, if you look back in history and say why the fuck were we in Vietnam, I need you to show up for these other fights when we get movements going for them. Because we can't fight for everything always. We can try, but we can't always. But there's a lot of shift in ability for us to go from, oh we're defending Palestinians, to Ode to Fendi Kashmiris, oh we need to liberate Ireland, oh we need to liberate Korea. But you know who doesn't have that difficulty? The imperialists are doing it. They can just send troops, they can just send warplanes, whatever. So there's this fantastic quote from a post-colonial feminist who said, our anti-colonialism must be as flexible and fluid and dynamic as the capital it is working against. And so I agree with the inevitable comments that these situations are different. But much much much much more important, at least for us who is trying to undo the harms and periodism has done in these situations, they are very very very similar.",

Call the press person who grew up in one of the most ethnically diverse places on Earth, speaks in different ways, hold it to different people. Holy shit, this is mind-blowing.

I'm not all serious in this, guys. If this is all they have on a brown man running on a socialist platform, leading a highly successful campaign to make buses free and have a communist-style grocery store plan, we're doing pretty fucking well.

So the knee jerk reaction is to shoot on Democrats, which like fine, but that's wasting energy just as much as they are. What we should be doing is ignoring their nonsense and just moving on with our life and building actual productive worker power. And I hate to be a leftist here, y'all, but it's really simple. Have friends, join a union, find mutual aid organizations, and find homies that want to do direct action with you. If you want to know about Democrats, fine.

    "text": "How do we respond when a Zionist says, it's not Israel's responsibility to give Palestine a state? Well, I'd ask, was it South Africa's responsibility to give the natives a state? Was it Rhodesia's responsibility to give the natives a state? What about Namibia? Because the idea behind this is that Israel, being a colonizer entity, is illegally preventing the Palestinians from having a state by merit of being an occupied body. So let me tell you a story. For those of you who don't know, this is Namibia, and for a long time, it was occupied at one point legally, and at another point very illegally by South Africa. That is because it was put under a trusty ship by South Africa, which effectively meant South Africa took up the responsibility to build a state in Namibia. There are lots of critiques about this trusty ship, right? And right for critiques. But what is important here is South Africa did not end it when they had an obligation to. So did South Africa owe the Namibian people a state? In this case, yeah, because they were illegally occupying it. And when you illegally occupy a territory, you, as an illegal occupier, have one of two obligations, to end the occupation in full, or to effectuate full rights to the citizens of that territory. It is undoubtable, especially since the 2024 ICJ ruling that Israel is illegally occupying Palestine. This means, yes, they do have an obligation to give Palestinians a state. They just do. You're wrong as a matter of international law. You're wrong as a matter of morals, right? When you're taking over a territory, obviously you owe obligations morally to the people you're taking over. And third, this was a comments left in response to someone saying that the offers to Palestinians for states were clearly unfair, which is correct. And I would love to see anyone try to justify to me why the offers that were given to the Palestinians represent it what they are deserving under the UN Charter of national self-determination of peoples in their native land. But you can't. And I promise you, you can't, because you almost certainly haven't read them. So that's what we say. You're wrong as a matter of international law. There's history showing that you're wrong and will not look good in history. You're wrong as a matter of morals, common sense regarding occupying bodies. And you're wrong as a matter of fairness. And finally, you're wrong as a matter of fundamental principles of international law being national self-determination.",

Now I'm very much like I'm not gonna tell the Nazis that they're not Nazis. Like I'm not gonna have them come up to me do a Nazi salute, say hey I'm a Nazi and I'll be like, let's think about that historically. You know what I mean? I think it's very important that we keep this word as meaning something. But that both means not overusing it and remembering actually what the Nazis did and recognizing and calling it out with extraordinary vigilance every time it comes back in history. There are two sides to remember it's you know what I mean? And so I think this is hesitancy online and in politics generally to call out Nazis that are now taking back power because we don't want to disrespect the past. And I think that's probably a good thing. We don't want to be the boy that cried Nazi. But I do think at least my take on this is they are so openly obviously actively calling back to Nazism itself and engaged in the exact same behaviors that the Nazis did. Like there is nothing you can really call the El Salvadorian prison other than a concentration camp that it just is more disrespectful to the people that were harmed by fascism and Nazism to not call it what it is. So I don't think this is a moment where we say oh we really should respect we know respecting the past is going after the current Nazis and we should be and people aren't radical enough about this. What would you do if a Nazi was in your town? What would you do if your uncle was working at ice or working at the fucking Gestapo? Like why is this not how we're talking of it? And I realize that people are and I'm trying to and I realize that it is inherently uncomfortable because there have been boys that cried Nazi right there have been overestimates there have been over attacks. I just don't think this moment is that. And I think once we actually start using the words that are accurate the complacency and complicity of way to many institution and people in America and the world become so much more clear and infuriating.",

Why do you think you weren't taught this? Why do you think most people don't know that one of the primary rhetorics they used was of social degradation, social decay. It's because it looks a fuck tonne like the exact rhetoric conservatives today are using to refer to the epidemic of trans people, the degeneracy, the threat to institutions of gay people existing. And also they repeated the exact same tropes, the trope of gay people being child predators when in fact the Nazis, the conservatives, the Christians, the churches are the sexual predators. And it went hand in hand with their anti-Semitic racist misogynistic tropes. It went hand in hand with the idea that not only were the trans and gay people pulling back the good German values, but it also was an invasion of certain races into the German values. So you need to get through all deviants. And it's so fucking dangerous that we have failed to recognize these very similar tropes being played out. Because while it may be only trans people labeled degenerates or defectives today, there is absolutely nothing stopping these labels, these arguments, these tropes that are existing in broad daylight in America today, being applied to literally anyone. It is dangerous for the majority of us who do not fit in perfectly to an idea of a ideal American according to JD Vance and Donald Trump. And we should stand up each and every time they expand that definition of a deviant.",

I don't believe in even the concept of homelands in this context, but even if we're not consistent, it doesn't make what you said make sense. And let me remind you, you claimed as a white fucking colonizer that Australia was your homeland, which is still nonsense. He's telling me to go back to Europe, more accurately Britain if I don't want to see what people being replaced, but... No, that's not what I said. What I said was that you are a colonizer, and if you want to play this game of homelands, go to your fucking homeland. I don't care about your pseudo-like victim complex about being replaced. I didn't say you could avoid everyone that's a minority because you go back to your homeland. I didn't say there was a safe place for white people, there's no Rhodesia anymore. We beat you a while ago. What I said was very simple, which is if you want to play this game of homelands, if you want to say they need to stop coming to our homeland, you should go to your fucking homeland, which is very clearly not Australia. Or, hear me out, you could even vaguely attempt to understand the idea that we believe in multiculturalism and internationalism across the board. So when I was saying you should go back to your homeland, I said that insofar as your white supremacist. And I just want to remind everyone seeing this, I don't respect this person. He doesn't deserve a response. He is just a very, very good person to bounce obvious rhetoric off because the great replacement theory is the most classic white supremacist nonsense. And mirrors almost directly the literal fucking Nazis rhetoric about Jews in Germany. It is so dangerous, this type of ideology should not be respected in any way, shape or form. But thank God he doesn't even respect the ideology because look at the source he uses. I think it's like by 2060, the majority of European nations will be minority white. Chatchee-meat. The man used GROC and Chatchee-P-T to disprove like nothing. So yeah brother, take that white supremacist as shit, put it into Chatchee-P-T and see if it thinks it's Nazi shit. I promise you your lord and saver, if saver, Elon Musk, right? Like apartheid Barbie can't even tell his AI that that's not Nazi shit. So I've said it before and I'll say it again.

I'd be like, oh, these silly anti-signists don't they know that like, they deserve genocide because they're Palestinians. It's like, what the fuck are you doing? It's hard to do serious analysis on this. But like, if I had to pin this down to something, my anger with this type of content is first, it's not treating serious issues seriously, right? Like, you're not telling me why you're any of these things. You're just like trying to in me over by being like cutesy. Number two, these are serious issues. And when you present it this way, it's not like possible to engage with as a debate. Right, you could put any crazy fucking thing on there. And then when I get annoyed at it, you're gonna be like, I was just trying to do a cutesy little video. Third, you're like trying to conform into gender stereotypes to justify your stuff. Right, you put like, I'm from Artini. I just love capitalism because I can get like a Chanel bag. And it's like, why would we do this? It's a weird type of like socially liberal that also just like actively reinforces gender stereotypes and sexism, which once again, you're not taking seriously. So like, we can't actually engage on. I don't know. I think it's less of a logical anger at this type of content. And more just like a vitriolic like, because at least like white supremacists that like argue it and like stand up and go like, yeah, I think I'm racist. Like, I can actually engage with like what they're saying or like, like homophobes who like do homophobic shit. Like, I can actually engage with the thing they're saying and be like, no, this is why you're wrong. And this is why it's stupid or at least you own it with your chest. But like with this stuff, you're just like saying it and kind of like cutifying it to an extent that it can't be engaged in. Yeah, let me know if you all have thoughts on this.",

I never defended Kamala, I actually did not endorse her and habitually criticized and condemned her. There may be times that flagrantly wrong statements were said about her that I corrected, or incorrect criticisms were levied that I stopped. But that is not support, and it's not even really defense. But most importantly, why are we doing this still? If you accept the leftist thesis on anti-electoralism, it's a thesis on power, where we put our energy, where we put our work. So if you accept it, go do other valuable work, talk about other valuable things, bashing other leftists who choose erroneously to talk about electoralism, is contrary to your point. Especially, I get like pushing the anti-electoral point, but especially on a post that isn't about electoralism. What are we talking about? We need to start educating people on how to actually put their effort and see the rewards from that effort, so that the Dems can't come in and say we have no plan. And if we continue to just focus on the one thing that everyone hates leftists for, which is anti-electoralism, we're just gonna keep getting hated. What are you doing?",

Peter Teal is the guy that funded JD Vance's original senatorial campaign has made a shit ton of money off of DeGenereside in Gaza and has advocated active eugenics in his articles. But I want you to really think about Peter Teal because he represents, in my mind, the new wave of weird fucking fascists. Because this is a reminder that old fascists had a lot of really weird beliefs. And a lot of them wanted to feel important and like they were academic, like they were smart, like they were better than everyone. And Peter Teal is exactly that. He writes academic articles in shit that he has no expertise in. Sociology, philosophy, political theory. He made his money through defense contracting and cucking himself out to the imperial core. Not any of these things. And his philosophy is trash. It is just flagrant eugenics with some cryptocurrency language. But he does matter not because he's smart, not because he's contributing to the academic discussion, but because he is corrupting the shit out of the American government. Palantir, his organization, is funding and supporting the genocide in Gaza. It is building AI controls, tools that we tested out in the periphery and now are being used by American law enforcement, the American Gestapo. He is the reason JD Vance, that fucking weirdo, is in power now and is the reason a lot of these weird fucking beliefs are still around. So if you want to understand the new American weird right, he's a really good place to start.",

This, I don't love it. It's basic. I don't find it that interesting. This as well. Not terribly interesting. Not terribly compelling. On the other hand, this art that I saw in Lisbon, I love it. It's great. It's fantastic. I don't mean to say that there's not bad art. I do think there's bad art. I think there's art that I don't enjoy. And I think there's art that basically no one enjoys. I think all these right-wing losers cause playing as like art critics for sincerity of art or, or, or, or compelling this or whatever this being a decay and art. I don't think you understand the point. This is compelling because of its modernity, because of its ordinaryness, right? The fact you make a bronze statue out of a seemingly typical observation, especially people that are underrepresented in such mediums, is itself interesting. It's a juxtaposition. But even if you don't find that juxtaposition compelling, you don't have to find it compelling. There's a lot of art I find deeply uncompelling and is in very large public spaces. The reason you're angry about this is because it's a larger black woman. That's just a, there is nothing special about this other than it being a larger black woman. And so it's hard to look at you losing your mind and care about anything you're saying other than just thinking that like it doesn't conform to your ordinary worldview and thus it is causing emotions in you. Which is ironically exactly what good art should do.",

    "text": "I'm not mad that Donald Trump is president because without him in office a lot of people would be unwilling to address. That is not accelerationism and it's important we understand what accelerationism is and the value of the commentary he made. And where it can go wrong. So very quickly accelerationism is the idea that leftist should do one of two things. Make things worse to cause a class conscious backlash or make the class conflict more apparent. I.e. the assertion that liberals and fascists are essentially the same. So we should support fascists because they're more obvious about it being evil which causes a better class conscious backlash. Strictly speaking the point he made in that video was not that. He just observed that there will be a backlash due to Trump and then he went on to equivocate a lot of the things the Democrats and Republicans do. And I don't think they're equal and that is where I think the main harm with this critique could go. Which is to undermine the very real and somewhat unique challenges that certain people will face under a Trump regime that they otherwise wouldn't face under a Democrat regime. But that issue can't be overstated because what is entirely understated by a lot of narratives is that the difference is comparatively thin especially when you take away privilege. What we are seeing is a widening of the net to of the like military state of the prison industrial complex of the barbarity of like American fascism to people that otherwise had privilege. And an increased in brutality against those that don't have that privilege. But these tools existed prior to Trump and it's important to recognize that. And it's important to recognize that because we don't want a liberal backlash because when you see fascism when you see far right things you effectively have two options when people say oh shit this is evil. You get a class conscious backlash which is what we're going for. We want people to recognize the issue is not that Trump's being mean. The issue is that he's a fascist funded by oligarchs right and we need to undermine the very system that caused him. Or you can get a liberal backlash which effectively comes down to he's being too openly racist he's being too openly misogynistic too openly homophobic. He needs to reel that back in but we're not going to underdress the underlying economic system that led to fascism. And if at this moment we fail to recognize that the system liberals built led to Republicans having this power having this fascistic attitude we risk sacrificing the benefit the very real benefit that political response can have. And that is not to say increased damage increased harm increased risk to a bunch of people is not happening. And that's once again where this narrative can go wrong. But it is to say a clear-eyed view of what is happening a clear-eyed view of what did happen and what led to this moment is just as important as a clear-eyed view of how when and how many people are needed to fight this shit.",

    "text": "It's much meat Hassan Piker, the 33-year-old streamer telling Gen Z that socialism rocks. Israel is a settler colonial estate and Zionists are in the Onazis. Meat the Free Press. An organization that claims to be a new media company built on ideals that were once the bedrock of American journalism. Showing ideals of honesty, doggedness, and fierce independence. When you take two seconds to look at their founders and editors, you find out that the founder is Barry Weiss, who you might have heard of for making documentaries about how she felt intimidated because a Columbia professor talked about Israel. Or Abigail Schrehr, who is literally repeating Nazi level anti-trans propaganda. There is nothing independent or dogged about this Free Press. It is founded by an vowed Zionist who has spent her career dogging upon anti-ionists. The very academic engagement of Israel by a professor at Columbia who was literally hired to talk about in the Middle East caused her to feel like a victim. This alternative, independent media organization, according to the Wall Street Journal, increased in 62% in viewership following the October 7th war. And that is because this organization was never meant to be independent or alternative. And it is exactly built on the ideals that were once the bedrock of American journalism. American imperialism, and anti-queer degeneracy. So when you see shitheads like this coming after Hassan Piker, when they will feel like they are victims even when a Columbia professor talks about Israel, even when people dare observe that Israel is a colony doing a part-side. You know that he is doing something right. And just to be clear, I don't agree with Hassan on everything. I just think that when an organization that uses these obviously obfuscating language, Free Press, foundation of American democracy, you know, honesty, doggedness, but literally spend all of their time defending Israel and providing an alternative, baseline, apologetic position on Israel, they have nothing valuable to add to a discussion. It is not a good faith critique. They are going after anyone that disagrees with Israel for any reason.",

    "text": "How that Israel has been, at least a little honest about its plans with Gaza. It is a good time to remember that the Gaza Strip has never been part of even their mythological claims to the land. Ever, on no mapping of Judea, was the Gaza Strip part of Judea. I say this not because it's the most important thing. The most important thing is that they're going to genocide or ethnically cleanse two million more Palestinians from their native land. But it is important to understand the fascistic underpinning and justification they will create for this. This is not a holy war. This is not a religious battle they are fighting. They are claiming land that they have no religious claim to, even though they are supposedly far-right religious extremists. That is because this is not religious. It is fascistic. And they are leveraging religion. They are leveraging Judaism and demonizing Islam to justify fascistic expansion and ethnic cleansing. And it's fucking nasty. There's no reading of history that suggests this. There's no reading of religion that suggests this. This was never about religion because this is fundamentally opposed to even the religion they claim to be supporting. And once again, I know it's really uncompelling to look at the theoretical, the philosophic background of these things that they're doing. When literally we're seeing them murder, women and children every single day and that should be the focus. But if we are attempting to undermine every single piece of justification that they're proposing, it's important that we sit and recognize. They are not acting even in a tenth of good faith regarding religion. They are engaged in fascistic expansion, imperial expansion, and justifying it on any grounds they can. Self-defense by definition cannot justify annexation. Self-defense can by definition not justify ethnic cleansing. And yet they are using it to do both. Their religion and the religious mythology they're running off by definition cannot make a claim to this land and yet they still are. It is not just that they're incoherent. It's that they are intentionally, motivatedly, incoherent to justify whatever they want. And that changes how we address it. It's not an arguing matter. They are making assertions that are obviously false, not as expressions of logic, but as expressions of power. And as long as we continue engaging with it as logic, rather than power, it is a standing threat that they can take whatever land they want. It is a standing threat that they can murder women and children in self-defense. They can label you a terrorist and kill you and anyone ever related to you. And as soon as we recognize that as an assertion of power, we understand how to treat it. But as long as it is an assertion of logic, it is equivalent in civil debate which will never actually undermine them.",

That is from an account called Builders, Middle East, which is an offshoot of Builders in America, which tries consistently to facilitate civil dialogue between the right and the left in America, which always just so happens to fall within dialogue that is acceptable to American imperial goals. As we saw here, centrism lacks the tools to notice what dialogues are silenced. They take the obvious open discussions and ignore the power and balances here. Like for example, in this case, they don't ask the question every leftist in their right mind would ask, which is not, oh, why do we love Iran? It's why does it seem that the Iranian government hates America? Why would they do that? Not to justify, but to understand. And this is what I mean. The right has their answer for why Iran hates us. The right thinks it's because they're Muslim or because they're Arab, even though they're not Arab, right? It's because they dehumanize them and think they just inherently hate democracy and freedom. The left also has its answer. We're not silent about it, we're silenced about it. The reason the left thinks Iran hates America is because America uprooted every single attempt at democracy they ever tried. They have consistently undermined civil and liberal society in Iran, and they consistently and continue to undermine most things Iran attempts to do. They've needlessly bombed the shit out of Iran multiple times. So we don't need to justify what Iran does or what they believe to sit and notice that centrists like these simply fail to recognize the very racist narratives on one side and the very undermined narratives on the other. But a centrist views them as the same. They fail to see the racism on the right and they fail to see the silence narratives on the left, which means they end up precisely where American imperial goals want them. Only having access to the left ring arguments that are bad and only having access to the really sensible, right-wing arguments because they haven't been forced to show their racist hand. That's infuriating, and it's fucking dangerous. There is no equivocation of the right in left in America, and Democrats also aren't on the left in America. If you want to build silver discourse, condemn every administration that has flagrantly murdered socialists, then we can talk. But as long as you're fear-mongering about the Middle East to continue justifying what will eventually be clearly be American intervention in it, you're not in the center, you're far, far in the pockets of the right-wing war hawks of America.",

    "text": "I don't believe in prisons and neither should you. And that is to say, you don't believe in punitive justice. So let's break down what that looks like. Because I agree it's hard to imagine the world without prisons. But let's break down what prisons are. There are two things, basically. There are slave camps because slavery is legal within them. That's a very defining feature of prisons. And number two, the reasons people go in them is punitive justice as a main justifying ideology. That is to say, it's not that we think society is better off because we put them there. It is because we think they deserve to be there by merit of what they did. And that would be different than, for example, rehabilitative justice. We're placing people who need to be rehabilitated to be better for society in places where they can rehabilitate. Or like a very intramentalist view where we only put people away from society. We restrict their liberty if they physically can't be within society safely. Right? But it's not a punishment. We're not saying you did something bad. And so we're just going to treat you bad. It's just saying this is what's best for society. And I personally ascribe to those latter two much more than I will ever say, you did something bad. Therefore you deserve to have bad done to you. I think that is immoral. I think that is wrong. So when I say abolish prisons, I don't mean abolish places that we send people who do bad things. I mean abolish places that we send people who do bad things because they do bad things. Do you understand? So if someone's like a serial killer and says they're going to do it again if they go outside, yeah, I want to put them to another place. I just don't think it should be number one, a slave camp where they are slaves because I don't believe in slavery. And I don't believe number two, it should be unduly harsh because that person, why would we abuse this person? What's the goal? What is our aim? Is it to convince them to stop doing it? Because statistically, the best way to prevent someone from committing crimes again is to rehabilitate them and then release the back into society so that they are productive. But if it is just to be abusive, it is just to cause harm. I don't believe in that. And we have some models for this. We have models of like the Nordic countries, for example, which have their problems, but put people in jail for much, much less time and have fewer crimes and the people that work criminals commit less crimes after they're released on average. This is because they have rehabilitative programs within these prisons. And we have a bunch of countries that don't have slavery legal within their countries of prisons. So yeah, when I say I want to abolish prisons, I don't mean I don't want somewhere for people to go where they're literally going to immediately kill someone else. But it does mean that if you do a non-violent offense, I don't see why we would separate you from society. I really don't. I don't see why we would punish you. I don't see the justification unless you were going to do it again, in which case, there are much better ways to do it than just abusing the fuck out of you, which is what prisons are. And finally, I just don't see any excuse for slavery within them. So that's what I mean by abolishing prisons. It's very complicated and I can't cover it in a three minute video. But if you have more questions from that, that's the general ethos of the assertion.",

There are some people that call themselves liberals who are on the left, but liberalism, especially in the modern era of neo-liberalism, is not the left. It is actually very far right. And know that some, especially liberals disagree with this no-wing culture, but if we go back in history where these terms started being used more, liberal really referred to two types of people within the modern era, a social democrat, right? So think FDR, think the founding of the EU, etc. social democrats, and then neo-liberals, think thatcher, think Reagan. As a very basic distinction, right wingers believe in capitalism, fundamentally believe in the free market, and left wingers don't. They either want to reform capitalism into a socialist system, or abolish capitalism overall and replace it with socialism or communism. Neither social democrats nor neo-liberals want to abolish capitalism. FDR explicitly reformed capitalism to maintain it, not to challenge it. And right wingers clearly just wanted to make it worse with free unregulated capitalism, the neo-liberals. Like the basic historical background why a lot of leftists say that liberals are not on the left, because they are either social democrats, which that's a dying breed, or neo-liberals, right, who just have some social views that are further to the left, then republicans. Then if we go into like the modern era, right? Kamala Harris doesn't support universal healthcare. Ronald Reagan did. If we want to have a discussion about who's left, I think no one in the right mind would say that Ronald Reagan is on the left, but Kamala Harris has more right wing less socialist principles in some cases than Ronald Reagan.",

If you actually believe that criminals are more of a danger to the labor movement of the United States, which has been cucked for 50 fucking years by the CIA, cops and neolibs, I need you to get your mind checked. No, you know what a real threat to the labor movement is? The idea that capitalist can just have to convince you that one of your comrades is a violent criminal and thus can take them out of the movement and put them into a slave camp to keep you in line and afraid of them doing the same shit to you and that you won't step up for the people that are thrown in jail for this reason to protect yourself from the same thing. That's much more of a threat to the labor movement. Are you fucking kidding me? Just to be clear, the prison system as it exists right now exists as a standing threat to the working class. If you protest in a way we don't like. If you strike in a way we don't like. If you dare to be poor and sit on streets that you own, we'll throw you in jail. It is a threat to the working class to keep them working. And if you believe that threatening that prison system, releasing the violent criminals that they have thrown in jail to threaten you, is more of a threat if you're releasing them, is more of a threat to us than it is to them? You've lost your goddamn mind.",

They committed genocide massively against the Herrero and Nama people in their colonies. British were the first to develop concentration camps in South Africa. The Portuguese learned from the Germans in World War II how to make concentration camps they then used in Angola. It is important to know this history but it is also really important to understand it so that we don't fall into the liberal trap everyone wants us to. The struggle in Palestine, the genocide being committed by America and Israel in Palestine is not only an issue for the Palestinians. It is obviously their issue right now but that is a training round and has been a training round for what American fascists want to do at home and across the world. When someone tells you that you need to sacrifice solidarity and support for the Palestinian people to solve fascists, problems here at home tell them that there is no difference. They are practicing their ice was trained in part by IDF soldiers. The IDF has trained with United States cops. Technology developed to track and control Palestinians lives has been used domestically by America against the protesters supporting those very Palestinians. It is not a distinct struggle and while it is affecting them unequivocally more than it is currently affecting us, it is still both a solidarity issue because one people struggle is every people struggle but it is also directly our struggle because every gun that is developed to mo down Palestinians will be turned inward and that is what we are seeing.",

But that is not my goal. My goal is to provide genuinely leftist takes on genuinely leftist goals so that we as leftists can actually organize to fight fascism. And I think the people I am not pulling in, fine, I don't really care to judge you. I want to speak to people that want to fight fascism and tell them how to do it.

    "text": "Why are prisoners necessary for any radical action in America? Great question. And what are the risks? Because I'm well aware that there are issues with aligning the labor movement with the prison abolition movement. So let's break down some of the analysis that I got me to this position. Because I agree, a mass strike is a very different action than a prison break. But very simply, in America, our workers have basically no power because the unions have been destroyed and are fundamentally aligned with imperial goals. This is just because by definition, the American economy is one of empire. Our two biggest exports are oil and airplanes, defense. So when we think about a mass strike in America, we are thinking about workers who either work on international capital, support, accountancy, services, etc. That are inherently their interests are aligned with international capital. Or the much more powerful group, because they are actually manufacturing at home, are by and large manufacturing military or oil related goods. And I promise this is relevant. The issue here is that the workers are either weak because they don't have unions or are actually quite feckless against working against genuine fascism. The best we can do is replace it with another imperial like liberal order. And I sound crazy here. I'm aware it sounds radical, but just genuinely sit and think about it. Workers are interests align a lot with Trumps. He wants to change the empire. He wants to change how it works, but he still believes in an American empire, so do liberals. The reason I believe prisoners are necessary, at least one necessary piece of this puzzle, is because their interests are genuinely divorced from the American empire. That is because they are the real pro-viterate of America. They are the slaves of the American slave state. The Wall A Workers' Strike can disable the functioning of the empire as it goes. The most it can conceivably ask for is a return to the way things were, a return to the brunch and day-to-day of an empire working and exploiting the global south. Prisoners on the other hand can demand radical, fundamental change if they are mobilized, because their interests are divorced from it. So it's kind of a very high-level observation, and in actual practice what this will look like, will be individual towns and townships and cities, weakening prisons, and eventually fundamentally altering that power imbalance. I don't have a great faith in America for General Strike because we don't have the community for it. So that's where that take is generally coming from. I can't go longer than three minutes, so I can't go that much more into it, so if you have more questions, please engage with it. But secondarily, final, final point, Trump doesn't need an excuse to declare martial law. He really doesn't. Right? Like, we must resist as much and to the largest conceivable extent all of us can, because Trump isn't respecting the law.",

    "text": "If you support a general strike, you must support a prison break. Actually, I'll go a step further. There is no such thing as a general strike without prisoners striking right by us. And people need to get a lot more radical on this really, really quickly. Because America is still a slave state. Billions of dollars is produced in economic good, produced by slaves within prisons. Thousands of people are unjustifiably kept in prisons. Perfectly, legally, just to serve the aims of the corporations currently funding the fascism taking over America. And prisoners are some of the few people whose material interests are actually disaligned with the American fascist and the American Empire. And I understand and appreciate that this is one of the most difficult section of people to organize, to rally for, and to rally support for, by the very nature of that identity. But us as leftists, I don't have this anthem. Need to sit and think of them as the real proletariat within America and how to actually mobilize and engage them. Because if we don't, all we will have are the people profiting off of that slavery, which we must have, right, we must have the petit bourgeoisie of America. But that will never be fundamentally revolutionary because they are material conditions. What their interests are, will always more align with the American fascists. Think about it. The largest export America has is military. More than it aligns with the actual people of America. So there's a lot more to be developed there and there's a lot more thought. And I really want your ideas on how to actually engage in this because this is not my area of work. But if we can start moving in that direction and every time someone says a general strike, ask them if they support a prison break. Ask them what they're going to do about the prisoners, what they think should be done. Because they will be victims number one, right? Trump killed more people through the death penalty than any other president in the past 30 years. So they will be victims number one and they will be the most important revolutionaries. Because they are the most oppressed by it. Almost by any metric. So if you're talking about general strike, that is one of the things you should be talking about. And then we can talk about how to fucking destroy these fascists.",

    "text": "Fascists want you to panic because when you're panicked you can't resist. The flashy media, the uproaring liberal speeches against it, and their immediate quick consistent action is meant to incite a feeling of learned helplessness. This does us no good and is a purpose of the fascist media strategy. It's clear, and the only way we can respond to it is by being very clear-eyed about how to actually undermine what they're doing. For example, if you're at risk for deportation, you need a community that can protect you, hide you, or get you to the Canadian border. Our job right now should be facilitating that building of community. If they order your workplace to do something, you need a union that can and will say no. If ICE wants to come in your school, the PTA needs to make damn well sure that administration doesn't allow it to happen. That's an incomplete and not very full list of things we can do to build power. But do you see what I mean? The best way to combat this very panic-inducing media ecosystem is to be centered in what you can do, what does work, and what power we do have. And then they can't panic us because we're in this fucking together. The fourth and final thing, which is for those of us who do have platforms and want to build them, is to build media that works outside of this fear. First of all, because they're gonna come and censor us, we know that. They already have the billionaires that own our platforms in their pockets. But second of all, so that we can actually not just like in 30, 60 seconds talk to y'all, but actually build media that communicates what needs to be communicated. And what that looks like and what I'm gonna eventually be doing is making a sub-strike owning my audience so that I can communicate y'all with y'all productively. But generally, that means that we need every voice we can building across any platform we can. So let's do what we can to reduce this panic response and actually respond productively so that we can resist effectively.",

No. In all seriousness though, Pope Francis is probably gonna be the best Pope we get. So let's relish what little good we get out of the Catholic church for now. If you're a Catholic and you don't support an immediate unconditional ceasefire in Israel, you're a fucking even. He spent his last moments begging Catholics to end their support for the horrors going on in Gaza. He said it wasn't a war. How the fuck are you gonna support Israel after that? He's the guy talking to God. You're a Catholic and you judge gay people or judge trans people. The only way he hated on gay people was in a very funny way talking about using the F's learned the Vatican. And I'll just say he was right. So ultimately I will never support any Pope.

    "text": "You're trying to get to Washington. My question number is that it makes a lot more sense to fly as close to Canada and then drive the rest of the way. However, there are only two flights. One is flight, and the rest of the way I want to take to Maine. Or you could figure out how to have a flight to Nebraska. Welcome to What's Wrong with Liberal. And I only want to make this video once. So this is my note sheet. Let's go through it. And let's first start with the argument he made. It's patronizing. We understand fundamentally what a lesser of two evils is. And lots of people actually agree that there is some material difference between Democrats and Republicans. But our critique is much more complicated than that. And when you just repeat the obvious, you're getting nowhere. So second, let's go into the actual analysis. What will Democrats do? Right? We're not seeing them really do much because they don't physically have the power. But when they did have the power, what did they do to prevent the rise of fascism? Did they run progressive popular candidates? Did they function? No! And importantly, during this non-stutial crisis right now, what are they going to do? What is supporting Democrats going to do? Is it going to get us to pass laws that Trump will just ignore? Do you see the issue here? Okay, let's say there is some points about, right? Who did the Democrats serve? Is their power electoral? No, they get majority anyway. Why are they not in power? What's their economic material? Well, is it unions? No, that's been dead. It's corporate. They are running off good billionaires. And if the corporations are supporting you, why do you think they're doing that? Okay, then we get to the leftist-have-no-solutions moments. Yes, we do. Liberals literally murder them. See Fred Hampton go and tell Fred to stop cops today. They literally just murder them. So no, leftist-have-solutions. You're someone hero. So let me go to why we don't like Liberals. Why are Liberals problematic? Because they support the impure boomerang. They developed a bunch of the stuff for the idea that is now being used in our Salvador, in domestic police forces. They are literally being trained by it. The C-Doc prison was necessitated because of interventions by Liberals into the global south. Okay? Then I think we get to the most important part. Where Liberals who very genuinely are concerned, you know, what do we do? Will, you're saying that the people we are coming into are horrible. What do we do? And here's my thing. You can vote for Dems. I did. Right? I ultimately think there is material difference. I just don't think it matters that much to actually prevent fascists. What I want you to do is think about how to actually empower a left. Where have real leftist parties gotten their power? Because I think you can look at the Democrats and say they're neutered. They, we can vote for them so that they actively openly evil like bad. Evil side doesn't win. But the Democrats ultimately don't have power because they don't have a power base. So what we need to do is power build either for the next election or for right the fuck now. From my view, that looks like labor, tenant debtors unions, mutual aid networks, localized communities, so that when the fascists come knocking, we can actually resist. And then if we get democracy back, right, we can make the elected officials do what we want because the people have the power. But right now that's not true. We can't just live in delusion about the people having power when the Democrats do what the people don't like. Ultimately take the choice of resisting fascists away from them, force them to. Finally, people go, will, what if I'm just lazy? What if I go into anything and I can only vote? Right? Here's the concern when you're a Democrat Apologist. First of all, if we return to normal after fascism, we're restarting this cycle. With the Democrats, we'll be fascist outside of America and it will seat back into America. Right? We're just going to keep doing this cycle until eventually the empire falls down and it will. And when it does, the Democrats are going to write the fuck down with it. Or if we can't resist right now and we don't return to normal, this constitutional crisis doesn't end, we get prolonged fascism. Right? Where we don't actually build power and the Democrats continue to be feckless. So here's my closing thought. If you are a Democrat Apologist, I just find you really annoying when you make arguments like this. I genuinely think you typically have your heart in the right place. So if you can think about things like this, remember, Trump is not imprisoning Democrats. He's deporting Palestinian protesters. The fascists are telling you who they are afraid of. Please fucking believe them and become them.",

Most recently, with Harvard, Harvard published a letter denying Trump's demands, and then Trump, after, came out with a bunch of angry mean things he could do, take down their tax exempt status, deny international students, bring ice on campus. And then today, and tomorrow, and next week, he's going to be releasing justifications for all of these things that are clearly punishments. Right? Oh, we weren't punishing you. You just failed to report something. Oh, you don't deserve tax exempt status because of your treatment of such and such group of people. And this is meant to erase your memory of why he actually didn't, while making sure that he reminds the institution that he can get away with punishing them. So the only real strategy we can take when we recognize that he clearly doesn't give a single fuck about the law is to ignore his justifications under the law. That naturally follows. We know the law doesn't make a difference to his actions, so why the fuck would I care what he thinks it is? What we have to say is any and all expressions of power by the Trump administration, we are going to do our best to undermine and resist with any and all power we have. We aren't going to wait until we're very sure every single fact about it is illegal, because when that's happened, they're already in El Salvador.",

So no, me reminding you that they did fascism too, just in like, you know, Israel and Vietnam and Korea is not me punching left. That's not division, right? That's addressing an actual problem. What is division is when liberals cause players leftists and then lose their fucking mind when they hear the term Stalinist or Maoist. It's fine to have critiques of those, I do. But if you're going to be a liberal, which is a fucking Obamaist, you know, and stand by the guy that bombed Yemen, I don't really care about your moral qualms with like it being uncosure to be named after a bad guy like Stalin. Do you see what I mean? Like, I'm not a Stalinist, I'm not a Maoist, I don't think it's great. But if you're going to lose your goddamn ever loving mind whenever you hear these terms, you're not trying to build a coheship, rainbow coalition. You're just kind of mad that we don't like you. If you want to build a coalition, you know, stop supporting the fascists, change your ideology or or or I'll treat you the exact same as I would treat a conservative that knows what they are, which is, you know, don't do that around me, don't do evil bad things around me, and I'll treat you like a human, and I think all humans deserve dignity and respect.

For example, if you ever tried to learn how to cook online, you're going to end up in the TradWife pipeline. If you want to get fit, you're going to get some weird bro telling you how to demean women. You like racing, fixing cars, video games, you're going to be radicalized into the right wing, and the left can and should turn around and take these back. And I'm already seeing this happen, right? We're seeing, thank God, the cooking videos from people being like, hey, you're going to be poor under fascism. Here's how you survive. That's left wing radicalism. It's just not insidious because everyone actually needs it. I think we can win this because we're fundamentally happier and more fucking likeable. We're already seeing this happen. Mutual aid fairs are popping up around the country because people need to know how to survive, and that is inherently always going to be more possible under fascism with a leftist mentality of mutual aid and community building. So please humbly take by short an incomplete list of places the left can take over. Run clubs! If you want to have fun comrades run with you, we can get fit for the revolution together. Cooking, either by videos or if there's a public kitchen around you or you can just do a teach in a public park. This is materially beneficial to people. How to fix cars. There are both media being produced about this and there are teachings happening in mutual aid fairs of people who are well trained on how to fix cars for free teaching other people how to do it. Anything that can get people together into community and help them thrive under fascism is going to work and we need these communities built around these different things. Not only for their content, we're going to need to learn how to cook when we have no money, but also because they are spaces where radical action can be organized and also protected. If I know enough people and trust in their ideology enough, if I do a cool thing I can go to them and they will protect me. That's the idea. And the right wing has this and has had this for a very long time. The left needs to build it and need to build it rapidly.",

That why makes it much more clear why leftists are very antagonistic to elected officials like AOC and Bernie who claim to be on our side and progressive. That is because people like them are used to appease people like us from doing shit that actually matters. This analysis comes from a very simple material observation. The left that you're pointing to in America doesn't have a different power source than the right. The Democrats are still funded by corporations. The same corporations that are funding the Republicans. They're still funding by AOC. The same AOC that's funding the Republicans. Us supporting the Democrats almost by definition cannot undermine the Republicans. If it did, corporations wouldn't be supporting the Democrats. And yet they do. But what do we do with this? Well, the answer is to build up a power base for the real left. Right? That can look like unions. That can look like actual functioning community, local organizations. Most importantly, it looks like understanding what these liberal institutions that are taking up all of the revolutionary energy, all of the anger contempt with fascists are actually doing. They're being a punching bag that can't actually do anything by definition. That's their purpose. Though it is wildly frustrating to me when people come on here who claim to be leftists, which I don't doubt, but then are so incredibly withdrawn from any leftist who critiques or even is actively antagonist towards someone like AOC or Bernie who are simply unwilling to critique a genocide. It's not a litmus test. It's just recognizing them for what they are, which is a product of the very system we're attempting to undermine. Us supporting them doesn't help change that system. It reinforces it. And I want to be very clear on this. I actually agree that there is a material difference between the Democrats and Republicans. That's been my position for a very long time. I do believe there is a difference. But that difference is best understood as Republicans being full-faced fascists and Democrats being liberals that are creating and supporting the system that creates fascists. Yes, under Democrats, it is mildly better. That is because they take up all of the response to fascists. If we want a real left in America, we must stop giving our energy to these apologists that built the police state that Trump is now using to terrorize people. And we must build real local power to support an actual left. One that hopefully can go into electoralism soon. But currently, simply doesn't have the power. We don't have the power to ever real-left in the electoral politics. So no, I'm going to critique Bernie Sanders and AOC and beg people to go to anywhere else with their energy.",

    "text": "If the Bricka is meant to keep Islamic men from thinking impure thoughts about women, why do the children also need to be covered? Why do your children wear clothes? Why? Why does a six-year-old wear clothes? What's the purpose? Do you ask this of the Kindergarteners wearing pants? What does that say about white English men? No! No, you don't. This isn't a good faith question. You're asking it because you think it promotes a certain racialized view of Muslim men as actual predators. But you don't even know enough about this topic to even in bad faith be making the assertion. Because the Bricka and the Hijab are typically not mandatory under Islamic law until puberty. I.e. when sexual features start developing. It's not actually mandatory prior to that, but once again, why do your children hopefully wear clothes? No. 1. Because it prepares them for when it becomes necessary in your culture, which by the way is pretty much always. No. 2. It's just decent. It's decency. That's the manner of clothing in that culture and that's what they wear. And manners of clothing do communicate things, but decency is a common thing amongst all cultures. And notice how he does this, right? He asks a bad faith question rather than making the assertion that he's clearly intending to make, which is a racist one. And he does this so that people that he's trying to communicate to, white supremacists, get what he means, and people that would actually attack him for this, which they should. Well, when they correct him, he will just say, yeah, I was just asking you a question. Duh. And then it makes us look dumb because we're just answering a question. So this goes beyond, right, intolerance. It's a demonstration and pride in ignorance. And the reason they're proud of it is because they view themselves as superior. So call this what it is. It's white supremacy. If he was actually interested, he would take two seconds to look up why and when he jobs are necessary. But it wasn't. It's not a question. He's not interested. He's just racist. And just for the record, I don't love forcing people to wear his jobs just like I don't love when Western society forces me to wear clothes. And finally, if he gave a fuck about sexual indecency, a hundred percent of his platform would go to calling out the current US president. Who is a sexual predator? Instead, he actually supports him. So maybe this isn't about that.",

No, the reason we shouldn't be talking about in 2025 is because it's Nazi shit. Let's let this white supremacist explain his white supremacist ideology. The great replacement theory is describing whether you want to believe it's being orchestrated or it's intentional. What it's describing is real, and what it is describing is the fact that what's being made into minorities in their homelands. First of all, not what it's describing. Great replacement theory is necessarily intentional. That's why the word replacement is there. Second of all, you are in Australia! You're an Australian! What do you mean you're homelands? Go back home! What do you mean? The level of delusional to have an Australian accent living in Australia. And then I believe that white people are the ones being replaced in Australia. Really is wild to me. But like importantly, this should go to show this has nothing to do with reality. They're playing logic because it's like the man-leafing to do facts over your feelings. But in fact, say the fucking homelands! But what are they trying to express? They're sad. They're worried. And they're not doing well. And so when you're feeling those things, you either find someone to blame, or you find a community that makes you feel better, so you can feel better than other people. And white supremacy gives that to them, even though it is delusional. The reason you've seen economic downturn along with immigration is because the corporations caused economic downturn because they make more money. And then they brought in immigrants for cheaper labor. But you saw the immigrants felt uncomfortable and just ignored the whole reason it was happening. And also it's just because white people have less children because white supremacy means they're wealthier when you're wealthier, you're less children. Very simple. But that logic even is not what's being expressed here. He's just feeling something and he doesn't know how to deal with it. So very classic man, he just strikes out an anger. That's literally what white supremacist ideology is, and it shouldn't be treated as more than that.",

    "text": "Now know how he's sending people to concentration camps. For inspiration, let's remember the Rosenstrasse protests. This was one of the only demonstrations in Nazi Germany that prevented Jewish people from going to concentration camps. And it actually worked! It prevented almost 1,800 Jewish people from being sent off. What's important to remember is two things about this. First of all, it was basically the only one because this shit is hard. Once authoritarianism has its way deep into the society, it is almost impossible to uproot it from the inside. Number two, this was non-Jewish people showing the fuck up. And illegally doing so. What they did was illegal. They didn't just demonstrate. They stormed. No points in history will ever be the same. But what we can learn from that point in history for this now, terribly familiar point in history, is that we, if we are to pull off something similar, number one must reject the legal and governmental system that they are using to oppress us. And number two, we must actually be able to defend ourselves and have the community to not be cops ourselves. If someone on that street was reporting to the Gestapo, it wouldn't have worked as well. And finally, the best thing to learn from that is that's typically not how it's going to look. That is what we would generally call a liberal reform. It saved some Jewish people, but ultimately it didn't actually threaten the Nazi regime. The best thing we can do at this point is try and not get to that point, which means we cannot allow authoritarianism to sink deeper into our culture. It's already damn deep. But the work right now won't look like the Rosenstrasse. We don't have the community and we have too many cops among us. It will look like killing the cop within and building that community. So if we must, we will get to that.",

The prison industrial complex that Trump is using right now to target non-violent offenders in America has been built up and supported by liberals for the past 50 years. And so while every single human being with any amount of power in America should be using that power to push back against this rise of open fascism, it is always incredibly important to remember that liberals cannot and will not save us because they built the system that he's now using to partake in fascism. I'm seeing a lot of people when I critique liberals be like, but Trump's so evil we need to use all our power to do it. Yes, I agree. liberals enable him. Who do you think gave him this power? Why do you think guys has so much money? Why do you think, actually, I'll do you one better. Why do you think El Salvador is so authoritarian? So there is enough rage. I think everyone's feeling it. I'm feeling it. I feel scared and I'm a wealthy white man. We need to keep our head in the game. Know what action will save us, which is mutual aid community building direct action and actual resistance with all power we have by all means necessary against fascism and what won't, which is an appeal to liberalism and structuralism when the very structures that they built are being used in their natural use to oppress the citizens. More we give into this, the more this stops. And Trump doesn't give a fuck with the Democrats think. Trump doesn't give a fuck with the liberals think. That's why he's not going after the liberals. Is Kamala in jail? Is she? No. The Palestinian protesters are. You see where we're at? Okay. Just wanted to make that clear. Now go out and fight fascism tooth and fucking nail.",

But I want to remind you, Parliament has every single ability right now to change it. Well you have every right to be mad at the Supreme Court for a bad ruling. You should be putting every single piece of energy you have into screaming and yelling at Kierist Armor for not changing it immediately. For my American friends, the UK Supreme Court pretty much ubiquitously can be overruled by Parliament with clear enough rules. And for my English friends, you already know this, don't let Americanism seep in, you can overrule the Supreme Court, do it. And don't be fooled by any politician, especially a Labour politician coming out and saying this is a case of judicial overreach or we just have to accept this. They have a massive majority in Parliament and every ability to change it. If they aren't changing it, it's because they support it. Their hands are not tied unless they tie them themselves.",

And this doesn't end at simple analysis, right? Like the Taliban, in the form of the Mujahideen, was funded by the American government. That doesn't mean that the Taliban, which was fighting America, was serving American aims, it just helps us understand back then and what they were doing then. And then maybe how to prevent such things happening now. And it also helps us draw a limit around how socialist they conceivably could be, or their actual real politics or aims. And I think, unfortunately, the internet is limited to a good or bad discourse. But that's not what I'm trying to have on here. I don't think any organization is good or universally bad. I just think that we want to understand what's happening so that bad shit doesn't happen again. And I am deeply skeptical of any and all things that Americans see I do because they literally, like I hate to pull the card guys, say to shit-tum of Nazis and also fund fascists across the world. So like, would you be comfortable saying, guys, just because, you know, fascistic Italy funded something doesn't mean it's bad. You can make this argue about certain things. And I would agree with some of them. But are we comfortable making it? You know what I mean? Like, I want to shift the over-tune window so far that, yeah, that's a radical position, probably a true radical position. But it's not the first thing that comes to mind. Because right now we've normalized the C.I. doing evil shit. It's like, expect it. Let's denormalize it and then that conversation can be had.",

    "text": "We're not having enough children to replace our current population in this country, which is a massive long-term issue. No, it's not weirdo. That's what immigrants are for. And I'm not exaggerating when I say this is like the third step down the white supremacist pipeline. Follow me here. When countries get wealthier, they have less children. That's just true. You don't need any outside force making that happen. But a country, especially a capitalist country, needs to continue have workers so that it can continue growing, which is the goal of capitalism, infinite growth. So it has one of two options, mass immigration, or to push the native population to have more birth. And both of these end in white supremacy. Mass immigration gets a backlash from the already kind of racist people seeing new different people join their culture. How do you make people have more children? Well, you do scare tactics like this shit, which is ultimately saying, we don't want immigrants to replace us, we need to have more white babies, which is just white supremacy. That's literally the 14 words of neo-nazis. And so whenever anyone brings this up, ask them, why can immigrants not just fill that void? Why is it a problem if more people come in here to do more work? Why must it be American babies that fill this problem? Because factually, America's population still is growing just because of immigrants. Why is that a problem? Because it's not stealing jobs from American babies, you're saying there aren't enough of them. The only answer you will ever get, and I've had this conversation 10 million times, is we need to keep our culture. As if our culture isn't just an amalgamation of immigrants. Now do I support this system where we have to continually grow? No, I'm a communist guy, like let's just be clear. But this is a natural outcome of capitalism. And it's fucking gross. That's why white supremacy and fascism grow out of neoliberal capitalism. Because they need to keep feeding the machine. And either you do that with immigrants, and then they demonize the immigrants so that they can give them worse working conditions. Or you make the generally white population, the native population, not native, but the population that lives there right now, have more children based off the fear tactics of immigrants taking their jobs. Do you see how that works? Okay, yeah, stop being white supremacists, everyone.",

We are calling out liberal, performative bullshit and not being satisfied with it. Because let's be clear, liberalism and corporatism is the enemy of queer liberation. It is not capable, much less helpful or likely to cause queer liberation. But let's see what your class analysis there is. We need to use the capitalist system to our advantage. We need activists just as much as we need assimilationists. And by demanding perfectionism, we are going to get nothing of it. So you fall into that camp of assimilationists and no, we don't. We didn't need gay kings, right? Because monarchy wasn't going to free us. And we sure as hell, didn't need gay slave owners and we didn't need black slave owners. What we needed was to abolish the system that fucked up the liberation. And we're going to have a moment of agreement. I do think we need gay people in high places, but they don't need to be like you that actually think like we need to use the system. They need to be there to burn it down. So I think you should become a CEO and then do whatever you can to burn it down if that's possible. I just don't really think that's possible because you'll end up being a shitty person after like 10 years of being a CEO. Factually, what we need is to be able to eat and we need to be able to fight, but culturally accepting corporations and capitalism and liberalism, God forbid, God forbid is crazy. And we should be holding them to the highest standard when they do rarely, possibly act for gay liberation. I think it's possible for them to conceive of the act for gay liberation, but that will never look like me lowering my standards. That will then be then deeply surprising me. We are not asking for perfection. We are asking for them to be something they are not, which is for gay liberation. And that is why they keep failing. And the answer is not to lower the bar. It is to try and change what they are or put people in power who are that. And that power necessarily cannot be from corporation because when it is from corporations, it is not for gay queer liberation. Do we understand that? We don't need the evangelicals on our side. We need to disempower them. We don't need the Republicans to like gay people. There were lots of gay fascists. We need them to not exist as an ideology. This is a bad take and anti-queer liberation.

    "text": "It is genuinely unclear why Trump is doing this tariff, but it is very clear this is the death of the US dollar. And I want to make clear why I say that. The US dollar has been built on US hegemony. It has been built on this delusion of the world that the US owns everything. But the only reason that is believed is because the US had the backing of force to do it. For context, one of the major reasons it was powerful was because of the Petro dollar, which was an agreement with Saudi Arabia that petroleum would only be sold in the US currency. That agreement has since been broken and they have done sales in yen and rubles. And the reason we originally got that deal was because we armed the Saudis. So it is clear that America's power has always been in its ability to control its vassal states, one of Saudi Arabia and mainly Europe. Following World War II is decimated and we took control of their defense. Now that Europe is rearming, they are more politically independent from us. And especially as Trump destabilizes the American economy with his actions, they are pushing to be even less dependent on us, whether that is further towards China or towards a more centralized European power. But overall, the more unpredictable Trump is, the more no one will trust the US dollar again and will move to build power themselves. So while the markets might recover and they probably will, because that's what capitalism does, what won't recover is the neoliberal hegemony that America has had over the empire. And while we want the death of the American empire, we don't want to be watching the death of the American empire because it is famously true that fascism is the dying gasps of an empire. And so while ultimately American hegemony needed to break at some point, it falling into what objectively will be a very dark time of increased fascistic tendencies within America is not something to be celebrated.",

No, they're not. They win in a recession. Here's why. Because they get shit for cheap. It makes total sense. If you are a consumer in a recession, your cost of living just goes massively up, right? You pay more to live. They get more rent. So capital is worth the same to them, but it is way cheaper because there's no real tail market and it is a recession. So they accumulate more and more and more wealth. They get rent from that wealth still and their personal wealth is protected because once again, they're billionaires. So they can pass off a lot of the cost to a recession to y'all. They're not going to start because they're not going to go down that poor. And in the time where maybe they go from being a hundred billionaire to 50 billionaire, their 50 billion buys up the whole economy. So when it booms back up, when daddy government comes in and buys them out, they are way wealthier. The terms are wild and we can talk about that, but the Republicans are doing what they've always done, which is push for a recession, which will always infinitely cost us working people much, much more than it will cost the capitalists. It is how capitalism works. And the Democrats aren't working to end that. They are just working to kind of ignore that that's a natural consequence.",

And this is not an attack on people that went to a hands-off rally, I just want you to be clear about what the true theory is. The 3.5% comes from a Harvard study which found that peaceful revolutions, whatever that means, were successful if they had 3.5% of the population's active participation. The revolutions it cites, the revolutions it cites are the people power movement in the Philippines, and the revolution in Georgia, which first and foremost had American involvement in them. This one quite literally is a color revolution. But putting that to one side, I want you to be super clear when you read this. This is not marching outside of government buildings. This is storming the parliament. Because that's what peaceful is. Peaceful does not mean lawful. Peaceful is storming the parliament and winning because if they don't let you win, there will be violence. That is the correct understanding of history. Gandhi won after 10 other successful revolutions against the British Empire, which were done violently. The deal the British made was that they couldn't afford to fight a violent revolution, so they left because they knew they had enough support in India to fight one. So when we see liberals using this language and this research to justify working with the cops to put together protests that are asking for the reaffirmation of the neoliberal system and doing no actual community building mutual aid resistance, it's like a little frustrating. You can see how that's frustrating, right? So I just want to be clear. First of all, this study is really questionable considering it doesn't take into account CIA involvement as a start. But even if you take it at its face value, what you should understand is that, yeah, peaceful revolutions in that sense are probably true and more successful because they got to be peaceful. They had the privilege of being peaceful. And that means that they had some other political power, either it was the threat of a violent revolution or in many cases, the threat of the American Empire behind them. But we don't have that, so we have to make it.",

We're going to be besties. I'm going to pay you a bunch of money and you're going to give a bunch of people jobs and you're going to make a lot of profit doing it. That is classic corporatism. He literally set up a council of corporations with the government to talk about how they could benefit each other. Mussolini, if you read the founding documents of fascism, literally described it as corporatism. He said fascism can be better understood just as corporatism and ultranationalism, which FDR's whole thing was about revitalizing the American spirit. Just like way better, more in-depth explanations that y'all should look up. But FDR did save the American economy. But by putting it through, what cannot be incorrectly called fascism at its time because it was putting together that ultranationalism and corporatism. I do not want a return to ultracorporatism because there is a risk it happens because it is a way that you appease the proletariat. You increase minutely the social safety net, tie it immediately to the corporate overlords. The government is in bed with the corporate overlords and the people who are reliant on the corporations, they're profiting a shitton. It works.

    "text": "The idea that America is being ripped off because of the tariffs other countries put on us is nonsense. Let's break that down. You may have heard a lot this week that, well, why are all these countries ripping off America with their high tariffs against us? And the short answer is they're not, because those are generally speaking tariffs on everyone. This is a little complicated, and you shouldn't have to know this because every economist ever agrees that what Trump is doing is crazy, but if you do want to counter that propaganda, here's the simple way to generally do it. There's this international organization that America is very powerful in called the World Trade Organization, or the WTO, and the general rules of that are to get rid of arbitrary, directed tariffs, and to generally allow free trade amongst the countries. It's a neo-liberal organization. And so one of the main rules was that if you're going to tariff another member of the WTO, you've got to tariff the good. So say you want to protect, say your Palper New Guinea, and you want to protect your lumber industry. The general rules of the WTO are that you don't just go after China and America and Australia, their lumber, but you tariff everyone's lumber so that you protect the industry, but also maintain equal trade between the other countries. And then you can also go to Australia and say, hey, we're tariffing everyone, but you and I should enter a general free trade agreement, and you and I should agree between us. So there are two ways you can do it, bilateral free trade agreements, or equal tariffs against everyone else. Once again, highly simplified, but generally. So the vast majority of tariffs that Trump is referencing when we're talking about renegotiating tariffs are those tariffs. England, now that they're free of the EU, just tariffing everyone a standard rate on certain industries that England wants to protect. And America just happens to also be a country. And here is the real kicker. America is one of the main reasons this trade organization exists because it massively benefits Western countries to be able to freely trade, right? When you hear free trade here, exploit the global south. And the WTO legitimizes in international law, America and the West bullying, these smaller global south countries that they want to steal resources from when they do protectionist policies exactly like Trump is wanting to do. So why Trump is doing all these tariffs is super complicated and I don't have a great model for it, but it is sure as hell not because America is being screwed over by its own trade organization. That is pure and utter propaganda. Europe is not screwing us over. Europe is our vassal state. We put tariffs on Israel. Israel is not an enemy of America. It's not about that.",

And... The mayor of London is Muslim. The mayor of Birmingham is a Muslim. The mayor of Leeds is Muslim. The mayor of Flamberg is Muslim. The mayor of Sheffield is Muslim. The mayor of Oxford is Muslim. The mayor of London is Muslim. So we'll stop you there. Not Latin, Lutin. Um, and I'm proud of you for looking up the pronunciations of those other places. But, maybe hear me out. Stick to your own country. Because if you knew anything about UK politics, you would know that the last prime minister was a person of color, was a Hindu, and was still a raging fucking asshole. So he'd get along very well with your type of fascist. But I think this kind of combination of open white replacement theory and weird obsession with England, shows something clearly. Because to them, England represents this historical call back to the European liberalist origins of American values. And specifically, their misunderstanding of history allows them to identify with English values as the origins of like white superiority. And then the corruption of England, as they see it, is the failure and the infusion of that. When that's not what happened at all, the vast majority of these Muslims came very welcomed from England because they were valuable to the English economy. That's just factually what happened. It's not a corruption. And then they came into political power because they were voted in. But they're not interested in that, right? And I want you to treat this as what it is, which is a truly wild, far right, me Nazi supremacy conspiracy theorist. Right. They are not interested in facts. They are engaged in some type of mythos about the superiority of the right race. And thus, any power gained by another race or even not race Islam, right, which has seen somehow as the peak antithesis to whiteness, is a threat to that mythology. And England and also Europe, like France, Germany, they see all of these as being invaded, feed into that mythos. So when Germany was going through this phase, right, they saw origins in the mythological Aryan race. But Americans are seeing their origins in their white superiority in the Europeans. And so I want you to be really hypersensitive to any claims about Europe when they are number one not factual. Number two made by people that don't even know how to pronounce the names correctly. And number three, super fucking racist.",

    "text": "Hi fellow twink, it looks like you're doing some apologetics for a genocidal state. Let's solve that. You say they all boycott Israel until it's the moment to boycott Grindr. That's weird. Hmm. It seems like you're engaging in two things here. One, rainbow washing, and two, just kind of homophobia, I guess? Because the subtext here is we're all just kind of too gay to get off Grindr. Um, which like lock me up, but second of all, Grindr's not on the target at least. If you actually wanted to think about if we were being hypocritical, right? You could look at the list and say, hey, pro-palies! You aren't following the list that you've all agreed to! This is a good time for all of you to screenshot and remind yourself of the list so that a weird twink doesn't make fun of you for using Grindr. And second of all, it seems the only reason we would boycott them is because their founder is Israeli-American and French, which quite honestly, it's an even match between the Israeli and French with the things I have issues with there. But it's a very simple assertion. We boycott the things that are on the list that will enable Israel to continue committing its genocide against Palestinians. And if you can point me to where the prophets from Grindr are going to the Israeli state or military or being used by the military to benefit them, I'll boycott it, guys. I'll move on to hinge. I don't know. And for those that ask, they're a very good reason to boycott Grindr. Mainly the fact that they won't put a age verification function on it and have turned information over to the Saudis. That's a good reason not to use it. But the boycott is specific. But he's not interested in that, right? He's interested in kind of being a little homophobic and then being like, hmm, you're not being liberal enough, so like two sides of that coin, and then also just anything to make us look bad. When actually, if you took two seconds to understand the movement, this is stupid.",

    "text": "Mutual aid in community building doesn't sound like enough to respond to the rise of fascism, but I promise you it's the best starting point we have. And let me try and convince you of that really quickly. As fascism rises, the American Empire falls, which means the support that we rely on, social security, public education, stamp, right? Like a lot of really basic things will start falling. And then in exchange for that social security, in exchange for that protection, you will need to align yourself with the new regime. In order to eat, you will need to allow the fascists some more power. And so the best way for them to not get more and more of your power in exchange for that thing is for you not to need them. And the only way you can't need them is if you actually have a neighbor that can give you eggs, or you have a neighbor that can fix your car. If you can't go to your neighbor to drive you to the airport, then you need to call up Uber and you need to have US dollars to do that. And a lot of them, so the less dependent you are on central institutions, the less dependent you are on large multi-glamourant corporations that will be appealing to the fascists, the more power you retain as a person. And that's what building out mutual aid networks is about. It's about that being able to survive through the fall of empire, and then also to attack fascism. When it happens, guys, someone's going to need to protect the guy who does it. When people do cool things, that guy's going to need a house to go to, food to eat. And it's going to need to be widespread enough of a practice that it's not immediately obvious who the person that does the cool thing is. So if people want to start doing cool things to fascists, they need to know that they'll have a community behind them that won't rat them to ice, or won't need to rat them to ice to get food. And we'll have physically the resources to feed them for a while, or physically the resources to hide them for a while. And God, I know fascism is winning fast and empire is falling fast, but right now what you can do is start building those community connections. Knock on your neighbor's door, figure out who's there, who's cool, who's not. Go to your job, see who else is frustrated, maybe they want to form a union. Go to your PTO, go to your school, see what other parents have pissed off about banning books. Find out who your allies are and work with them, because that's all we got.",

    "text": "Yes, watch Israeli propaganda. Part 15! There's 40 Muslim states. There's... I don't know, a good number of Christian states, a good number of Hindu states, Buddhist states. And then obviously hands with, but why can't there just be one Jewish state? Well my guy, hear me out. None of those states should be any of those things. The Hindu state you mentioned, which by that I assume you mean Sri Lanka and India, caused a shit ton of genocide to make it a Hindu state. The partition between Pakistan and India was one of the largest mass casualty events in the world's history. The Buddhist states, genocide, the Hindus. The Christian states invaded the Muslim states and genocide them. And then the Muslims invaded y'all and you're still mad about it. That's like the whole thing about the Spanish celebrating the reconquista. There's a re- this is an American speaking, which is wild because he references England, which has the Church of England, as if it has to do with America when we were explicitly made to juxtapose and work against this. It's not that it's a Jewish state. I don't believe in a Muslim state. I don't believe in a Hindu state. And neither do y'all. Whenever you point to how bad Iran is, right? You point to it being an Islamist state. Islamist literally just means a state run by of an four Islam. That's like your biggest slur and yet and yet. Whenever we go after y'all for the same thing, which is supremacy of one religion or one people, suddenly we're calling you out explicitly. When America apparently has spent billions of dollars fighting Islamism, even though it's actually been funding a shit ton of it. But that's neither sides the point. If you considered maybe that all of this is interconnected and you're on the wrong side, that maybe the Hindustani nationalists in India are horrible fascists. Have you maybe considered that Islamism, the exact thing you claim to fight, is not a great thing, or that Christian nationalism, which was literally a driving ideology of some of the worst massacres in the world, isn't ideal. And people say there shouldn't be a Jewish state. We don't mean there shouldn't be Jews in a state. Or even that a state can't have a majority Jewish character. The issue is when a state is four of and by Jewish people, just as it being four of and by Muslim people or four of and by Christian people. The issue is that it's for them, rather than for everyone in there because that necessarily means supremacy. Especially when you have an interest in maintaining a Jewish state, which how did Christians maintain a Christian state? For example in Spain when they took it over from the Muslims. How did Hindus maintain a Hindu state? When they expelled Muslims and genocide them to Pakistan. That's why we don't like it. And this is a weird inversion of victim and oppressor.",

Just to build on this a little more, you know who funded the people fighting against Nelson Mandela? You know who trained them? Israel. Israel was the closest state in the world to South Africa during its apartheid. And when it was successfully dismantled, a bunch of the oppressive whites in South Africa ran to Israel. But it goes even deeper than that. South Africa attempted to make these states called Bantu stands, which were effectively reserves for the Africans within South Africa. And surprisingly, the whole entire world came together to not recognize them and not a single state did. But one state invited their presidents to visit. You know who? Israel. And Israel got a special little shout out from the UN actually for doing this, because they were allowing arms into South Africa to arm the apartheid state, and were considering and promised, apparently, to recognize the Bantu stands. It's wild how uniquely evil Israel was regarding South Africa.",

Say it with me folks, if their terrorists can pick them! If their terrorists did the little to do, prove it! But Israel has detained people of ages from 14 up for over three years without putting them to trial. That is a huge portion of the people that the Palestinians are bargaining for. Second of all, they have bargained for a statehood. Ewhiddyet, they consistently bargained for a statehood. Hamas has stated explicitly their end goal is statehood, and yet y'all still get angry at that! Because you view the idea of a Palestinian state as an erasure of any diversity within that territory when that is explicitly not the goal. I agree with everything Hamas does. No, do I condemn many of their actions? Yes, but to flagrantly lie and suggest that every single person within administrative detention in Israel that is being bargained back for by Hamas is a terrorist? Is absolute nonsense! To believe that, you must either not care what anyone else says, or think that Amnesty, Human Rights Watch, and the UN are all in lockstep lying about who is in the administrative detention and why. Because every single one of those organizations has condemned Israel's administrative detention practices for explicitly holding children without due process for over six months. A war crime!",

You were thinking of the apartheid al-ethnose, committing genocide against a bunch of its population. That's the democracy you were pointing to. Let's see. Really? It's Israel. We're asking people if they would ever live there. Ooh, that's interesting. Wait, how...genuine question. How can you be a democracy when you don't allow millions of people to have the right to live in the country that they have the right to live in? Like, when apartheid to South Africa canceled a bunch of citizenship of native people and forced them into Bantu stands and denied them the right to vote, was that...was that a democracy? Is that your definition of democracy? Is democracy just when people vote? Because people vote in Iran. Like, people certainly vote in Lebanon. And as far as I check, those were in the Middle East. But no, you're arguing that they're like this liberal democracy. But you can't have that and then also commit genocide against people. And even if you don't buy that, it's a genocide, whatever. Expel over a million people and deny them in their ancestors who have a right to live in that territory, the right to vote. And then also deny the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, the right to vote, which you are occupying. You can't do that as a democracy because democracy means the people that are being ruled by you, right? Either in occupied territories or who have been expelled into neither citizenship or within your territory on our denied equal rights under your laws, have equal rights and equal rights of representation, which they don't in Israel. So no, Israel is not by any metric the only democracy in the Middle East. Either none of them are democracies, right? Because they're all flawed. Lebanon is a flawed democracy. Iran is a theocratic pseudo-democracy. It has some representation. And Israel is a genocidal, part-tidal pseudo-democracy. Or they're all democracies. You have to go one or the other. But don't you all recognize how this is playing on the exact ignorance that a bunch of Americans have? Because I'd be willing to bet about most of the people, probably 90% of the people that get asked this question, probably don't know the governmental structure of most of the rest of the Middle East. And they certainly don't know why. Because the best response to this would go, hmm, why is Saudi Arabia or Jordan not a democracy? I mean, you could argue historically, but especially Jordan, who supported the Hashemite kings in Jordan from getting power? Or why is Iran not a democracy? I wonder who subverted the democracy within Iran and over through their democratically elected leader? Hmm, who was that? Oh, that was America, right? So if you really care about democracy within the Middle East, maybe you should condemn the biggest funder and supporter of Israel, America who subverts a bunch of democracy in the Middle East, but until then, you are just pretending to be a liberal democracy to a whitewash your fucking genocide. So no thanks, queen.",

Because clearly, the state can't be trusted to give me what I deserve, otherwise every child would be eating, everyone would have free healthcare, and everyone would have a fucking roof with her ahead. So no, until this is discussed, the purpose of the state is not to be trusted with what people deserve. The issue with the death penalty is that the state is flawed, and that it's immoral. I think it's immoral. I don't think anyone deserves to die, but even if you hate them, don't think they deserve to live whatever, what you are saying to me is that you trust the United States government to choose who lives or dies. And you want to spend more taxpayer dollars because death penalty costs more. And you want to risk them being innocent and killed. And you are comfortable with the history of the death penalty where overwhelmingly poor and black people got put to it unjustifiably and innocent throughout our history. And you want to join the Taliban, China, and Iran on the list of who do death penalties the most. And then at that point, where were they? Were you saying yes, these are good bedfellows, and I want to spend more taxpayer dollars, and I just don't care about the history of it. I don't really know what we're discussing here. You see the issue?",

    "text": "This is your weekly reminder that America is still a slave state and we have more slaves than we ever have. It just moved from plantations to prisons. And so if you think you would be in favor of abolishing it back then, you need to be in favor of abolishing it today. Is it morally equivalent all the time? Maybe not. Is it pretty damn close when someone is thrown in jail because a racist caught, found an ounce of weed on them? And now they're a slave for Adidas and Nike? By the way, both of whom who use slave prison labor? Yeah, that's getting close. Especially when prisons have habitually been found to use inhumane illegal and unconstitutional practices, have deeply unsanitary premises and unjustified and illegally keep people in jail for longer. And I hear what you're saying, Will. Okay, maybe there are some people that shouldn't be in jail, but other people did really bad things and need to be locked away. Cool. My question to you is, what is the goal of jail? Is the goal to make money for corporations? Is the goal to spend taxpayer dollars putting money in the coffers of private prisons? Because America's carceral system doesn't make America more safe. Rehabilitative systems actually have been shown to work better. So systems that keep you in for shorter, give you skills to return productively to society, actually have been shown to reduce recidivism, the likelihood of you recurring the crime, much more. So if you want to save for America and less slavery and a system that is not inherently made to put money in pockets of corporations, call for the abolition of this prison, especially, especially now that the fascists are taking off their masks and very willing to throw right about anyone in prison.",

    "text": "Los Angeles has brought back the death penalty. And yes, you heard that right. L.A. So it's a good time to arm y'all with the reasons the death penalty is never acceptable. Especially because I promise you, we are going to see moderate Democrats push for the death penalty to appear tougher on crime. If you talk to some of these so-called liberals, here are three really easy ways to show them there is nothing liberal or acceptable about the death penalty, which is economic, libertarian and racial, because you're not going to win on the moral part. You can't just say it's wrong. You and I agree it's wrong. Can't just go there. Economic, the death penalty costs more than life in prison. It just does, guys. There are study after study after study that shows this. So if they're like, we shouldn't be paying for these horrible people's lives, great, don't keep them alive. Second of all, libertarian, do you trust the government? Do you put someone to death? Sorry, do you trust this government right now to put someone to death? Really? Once again, do anything to move it away from how bad, evil and horrible the person is and actually humanize the thing that's happening? Which is, do we trust the government to make that choice about anyone because you could be on trial there as well? And finally, racial, there is a massive history in America of the death penalty being exclusively or incredibly prejudicially used against especially black men in America. Which is incredibly problematic, not only because we shouldn't be putting anyone to death and certainly not in racist way, but because on average, people of color within America are more likely to be put in jail or put to death while innocent. And when you kill them, there is nothing you can do about that. So if we are going to be forced into this discussion again and we can't change people's morals in the matter of like one discussion, the way we can shut this the fuck down is by showing them that literally no principles in America except for just the flagrantly racist, carceral, evil principles that objectify any criminal in America that fascist told and used to unalive thousands justifies the death penalty. A bullishness, a bullish presence, a bullish cops.",

It means that we have more power, more mobilization domestically, to work against the fascistic regime, funding this. Because this is un-equivically a genocide. They don't even have the pretend made up excuse of October 7th this time. It is just pure unadulterated hatred. But activism is like a muscle. We're organizing together in mutual aid groups. We're getting connected as a community to support ourselves through fascism. And that means you have people to talk to if there's a corporation that you don't like in your city you want to protest. Or even do cool things too. You can certainly organize boycotts and protests and communication networks and security networks for those who do choose to do cool things. We can show up. The rule of law is dying in America. It'd matter if the protests are peaceful because they were cracked down on you anyway. So yes, it is absolutely atrocious and despicable that Israel is going back to genocide the Palestinians. But equivalently it's not unexpected. And this time from within the empire, hopefully we will have better, more organized networks to fight fascism domestically. And we can flex that fucking muscle to fight the fascism it's funding for in the late.",

Unless the concept of American values was created just so that it could justify intervention. Which by the way, nationalism was. Some of the first forms of romantic nationalism, like that which Napoleon pushed, was specifically created so that the French stopped fighting each other and went outside and started finding colonies. Hence, the start of the Napoleonic Wars. But this is the mind of iris of nationalism. It can't actually make sense to bomb and murder and pillage and kill in the name of especially liberal principles which America claims to justify. And yet we hear it all the time. You know what would happen to you in Gaza? Do you know how the women in the Middle East are treated? Of course that justifies our violent invasion in Iraq that left 3 million women and children murdered. Do you know how mass treats gay people? Of course that justifies ignoring the Palestinian actual people and bombing and starving them. And most recently, we're going to bomb Yemen because the Houthis are so evil. And yet as we saw from the release text, it's obviously not that. And I think this should be a clearing moment for Americans that have been susceptible to this type of ideology before. It is obvious that American values cannot justify these things because they themselves contravene American values. So if you really hold by liberal principles that respect freedom, the first precondition to freedom is for you or your family not to get bombed.",

And I'm a gay man with a medium rack, and of course I don't go to Zionist conferences that explicitly support genocide. Because just for clarity, they're at an ADL conference. Who is explicitly pro-Israel and whose highlights include running up all the Jettics for Elon's little hand gesture at the inauguration. So welcome to one of the stranger Israeli propagandas of my life, but let's keep watching. We're in with big racks. Of course we're the real freedom fighters. And there we have it, the first delusion to Israel. We got one more. We're in big racks. Of course I'm wearing my scarf, David, and a hostage ribbon. So yeah, they're doing what the ADL does best, which is conflating anti-Semitism with critique and advocacy for Israel. But we all know that. But what you might not know is this type of apologetics of getting women to sexualize themselves to get advocacy going forward for a genocide or state. It's not new. And they did exactly this by the way. Because Rhodesia did the exact same thing. They had hot white women come and say we are fighting for Rhodesia. And you, Ugly Man, who is only proud of his race. You'll get a wife. And it's the hot, fun, cool, punk thing to do. And we're hot by the way. Did we mention we're hot? And for those who don't know, the defending the state was murdering and committing genocide against the native population to establish a white state. Sound familiar? And it's not an accident that not only do they sexualize themselves, but they also explicitly do so in a way that suggests that they're available for people who agree. Gracks and I'm at this conference and hope to find my husband. This use of sexual propaganda is not unique to this video. And it's actually used quite a lot by the Zionist entity. The birthright trip, which gives young Jewish teenagers right in their peacorniness, by the way, a fun trip to Tel Aviv to party it up is often accused of being specifically a aim to have Jews marry other Jews and have that identity within Israel. They're trying to say if you come to Israel, you will have a hot wife, a happy life, and something to care about, which ultimately appeals to the exact type of wannabe fascist that they're trying to recruit. This is actually sexual objectification. The tools are not new. They are not surprising. And we just need to learn to recognize it because of how fucking disgusting it is.",

The reason unaliving a healthcare CEO is terrorism, but not that CEO causing the death of thousands of people is because this is systemically acceptable. Burning Teslas, that's only terrorism because of Elon Musk's proximity to the state. Otherwise, it would just be good fun. And this isn't just semantics. It's important because we have been conditioned to believe that terrorism justifies the state overstepping its boundaries. America used terrorism to justify the bombing and killing of over 3 million people in Iraq. Every single colonial government ever has referred to the freedom and resistance fighters as terrorists. Mahatma Gandhi, MLK, and Nelson Mandela all were labeled terrorists and tracked and actively fought against by the colonizing territory. In MLK's case, America. And when they don't liberalize, like MLK arguably did but still got shot by the CIA, they get shot by the CIA, like Fred Hampton in the Black Panthers. Why are police that murder disabled children having a difficult time in a park not terrorists? But Black Panthers literally feeding those children are. It's because they undermine the American Imperial project. So if you disagree with the rise of fascism and authoritarianism, having an America, don't buy into Trump labeling everyone a terrorist. And when he does, it's probably a good signal that they're successfully undermining his power.",

I've done gymnastics for 12 years, got a perfect score on the ACT, and don't look like a weirdo out in the snow doing a handstand. But also your politics shouldn't be based on who has bigger biceps.

While there is, good giggles to be had with how stupid the current administration is being with their op-seq, it's important that you understand the true atrocity that they are actually talking about. Because, at least since 2014, and even prior to that, America, Saudi Arabia, and Israel have been funding this side to beat the living shit out of this side, by the way, this side being where most civilians live. And I know everyone is going to comment that this side are the Houthis, radical Islamists. But so is, hear me out, Saudi Arabia, who is funding and arming this side. So what is the end game here? What is the difference between these two? One of them supports Israel and Saudi Arabia, and one of them doesn't. Because if you're telling me this is for getting rid of an oppressive regime, then why the fuck are you allowing another oppressive regime to do it? It's nonsense. So just put that to a side. What's important to actually focus on is, like many places in Palestine, this territory, as well as this territory, has been starving for the past 15 years. It has been one of the worst humanitarian zones on Earth for the past two decades, and no one talks about it. And so ironically, Peter Hague says little mess up can hopefully be a time to ask questions, why is America funding this terrorist regime? Why is America doing this to the Yemeni people? Because the best way that America gets away with their evil shit is the American people simply not knowing about it. To take a second, learn about Yemen, learn about the oppression of the Yemeni people, and fucking scream, kick, and drag every single time the American Empire wants to expand its power, like they're trying to do in Yemen.",

No one questions that. No one has accused her of a crime. The only thing she has been accused of is being pro-Palestinian. Or as the Trump administration seems to think all of us are pro-Hamas.

Every single ICE agent, every single police officer, every single government official following an order from a fascist regime. They are complicit or actively criminal. So treat them as such.

    "text": "You've all seen the release group chat of planning a strike on the Houthis, but this is not the story. This is, and everyone is ignoring this, and it's infuriating. Because yes, they're stupid, they're nasty, they're very cavalier, about bombing who inevitably will be civilians. But what's important here is that they're admitting they don't care about the Houthis. You will hear a lot of rhetoric within the next two days, three days, about how horrible the Houthis are. But that's not why they did it. They did it to restore freedom of navigation, which by the way, in wartime, the Houthis have every right to end, considering they are the ones in power in that territory. It's their territorial water. And second of all, because it reestablishes deterrents, which is just translated, beating the shed out of the Middle East, so they don't fuck with our cargo ships. And the reason they did this was not because they had some special chance at targeting a terrorist, it was because they wanted to determine the political narrative. This should be giving anyone that has devoted their life to this particular fissistic order, extreme pause, because they are admitting here that they're lying to you. And finally, I just want to note, these texts are not about going to war with Yemen. We've been striking Yemen for over a decade and a half, and it's not a war and it never has been. It's been a brutalization and mass starving campaign against Yemenis, because they are against American national interests. That is not a war, that is fucking terrorism.",

    "text": "If every real threat to fascists was already legal, why did Trump have to break the law? Why did he keep losing in court? Why did he have to change the Supreme Court? That's because there is some inertia to our liberal system. There is some inertia to institutions that have not yet been corrupted by fascists. There's some inertia to the political and economic system. And I would agree, fascists are incredibly good at counteracting some verdict or co-opting that inertia, but so are leftists. And I think this is the wrong way at least to think about action. There are lots of actions that are very effective in resisting fascists. That are illegal. I agree with you. And as fascists gain more and more power, they will make more and more resistance actions illegal. That's true. But this extraordinary black and white thinking is not helpful. And it actually unmotivates people from doing what they can. And it normalizes the type of legalization of fascism that is necessary to its implementation. Let me make that simpler. When people believe that there's nothing that they can legally do, when people believe that any type of resistance is already illegal, fascists just say, yeah, of course it is. It always was. But if we consistently, at least in our minds, believe and promote the idea that, no, it's fully legal to come out and say certain things. There's a line to this, then it will be harder for them to make it illegal. The people do have power. And giving up on that, I think, is the wrong method of responding to this. Quite honestly, I think it's a trauma response. And it's a fair one, but I don't think it's a helpful one.",

    "text": "Do we say all resistance movements are connected? Very often we mean literally. Because happy late St. Patrick's Day and here's a reminder that the IRA, the people that liberated Ireland, bind you, also trained the ANC in South Africa against allies of Israel, apartheid South Africa, and the Viet Cong who fought in Vietnam against America, who also fund Israel. The interconnection of globalism, of colonialism, of new imperialism is strong. It's actually incredible how many apartheid South African leaders fled to Israel following the downfall of their genocidal state. But it's also incredible how closely connected the ANC was to the IRA. They explicitly worked together. The IRA also set onvoys to train the Viet Cong in Vietnam, another successful resistance movement for national liberation. If you're celebrating our Irish heritage today, I want you to remember that as the heritage against the unified front of oppression. Because it is daunting to see the unified front of oppression, right, the axis of evil that is America, Europe, and Israel. But if you understand the wide spread and incredibly really powerful network of resistance, it gets a little bit less scary.",

Surely this completely unjustified, clear act of aggression will be condemned by Zionists. Because they seem to think that any ceasefire is unbreakable and the person that breaks it is horrifying. But of course not, that's not what it was ever about. It wasn't about the fact that the Palestinians broke a so-called ceasefire. It was that the Palestinians did anything. And when Israel does it, clearly unjustifiedly killing over 500 Palestinians already. One of the most deadly days in Palestinian history, that's okay. You don't even need to justify it with October 7th. You don't even need to make shit up at this time. Israel just did it. So it's okay. For anyone who hasn't caught on already, this isn't a discussion. When you're discussing with Zionists supporting Israel, we're not discussing logical, actual things that are actually happening. They're saying they're going to do something and you're asking them not to. That's not a civil discussion. That's a discussion about power. So if you aren't in power in America, you shouldn't be supporting this. There is no debate. They've given away the game. So listen to them.",

    "text": "It is not patronizing to suggest that the Middle East is as radical as it is right now because of Western imperialism. Let's break that down. The example this person took was Saudi Arabia, which is a great example. The reason the House of Saud is in power is because of who? The British. They funded them and gave them weapons explicitly in exchange for power and control of their economy. They have been habitually leveraged by America to go after Yemenis and agitate the Iranians. And aid in a bet Israel in attacking Palestinians. So yes, the reason the current power structure is in power is because of American imperialism. Now you might say, whoa, Will, what if instead of them other further fundamentalist groups would take in power? And all I have to say to that is let's see because we've never seen that. And everything that we've gone against seems to have been the less radical. For example, with Iran, we killed Mosadek, a liberal-ish reformer who explicitly was not a radical Islamist and certainly not nearly as radical as the IRGC, but we killed them and put in place the Shah, which led to the Iranian Muslim Revolution. American imperialism prevented Iranians from having a functional democracy and as a backlash we got extremism, which is a very good uniting force against imperialism. Not saying it's good, it's just good at uniting people, just for clarity. In Iraq, we saw the same thing when the West intervened, Al Qaeda gained more power and prevalence. In Palestine, we saw the same thing. Israel crushed the PLO, a secular organization, and then we get radical Islamists in place. So no, I don't think the West is the sole reason everything is the way it is in the Middle East. But we do know that on multiple historical occasions, America and the West actively worked against reforming and secular parties and organizations and led to increases in power or back lashes of Muslim extremism. And it is not patronizing to observe that history. It is dehumanizing to ignore it.",

To suggest that continuing military occupancy of a territory that is not your own is justified because the people there cannot be trusted when you as a occupying power have slaughtered those very people is the highest level of colonialism and imperial ideology known to man. And as precisely the language, the French use to talk about the Algerians while they slaughtered them. The Portuguese to talk about the Angolans while they put them in concentration camps.

    "text": "Yes, Northern Ireland is still a colony. And no, the Irish people have never voted for it to be colonized. Because of you who don't know, this is Northern Ireland and the integral part of the UK, and this is the Republic of Ireland. This was all colonized by the United Kingdom, and then they lost this part due to resistance and held onto this part, a majority Protestant portion. This has no cultural significance. This line is just a set of six counties that were majority Protestant. Which might I add is the definition of gerrymandering. So that should start to make clear the issue with this argument. A foreign nation does not get to invade, colonize, and settle, and illegally occupy a territory. And then cut off parts of it that it wants and has a majority support in, and say, these are now mine. It's not immediately analogous, but that basic premise is the premise that Russia is doing with the Donbos regions. It's not how colonialism works. The second major claim that a bunch of unions are in my comments making is that the Irish voted for it. The vote in reference is the vote for the Good Friday Agreement. Which for y'all who don't know was a multilateral peace treaty between the resistance organizations and the British. It also involves some of the Europeans, and just for the record, I think the Good Friday Agreement was a fantastically drafted document. It's also one of the main reasons the UK is part of the HIV still, the Human Rights Act still, because they legally have to to follow the Good Friday Agreement. But that does not mean that actually seeds the Irish people's claim to that land. That was an unequal bargaining. Okay? It is a foreign occupying power, the British, that have much, much, much, much more power, because they were saying they will stop committing violence against the Irish if they make certain concessions. Then it created a crippled democracy, at least from my view, which required co-consiliation between the unionists and Republicans. Which made a vote as we have seen for a United Ireland, which now the border polls are showing is in support, especially following Brexit, very, very difficult, because you cannot form a government effectively without support of unionists, people that don't want a united Ireland. That brings to the third major point, which no, the Irish cannot at any point just call a vote. I know the Good Friday Agreement says that if the Home Secretary ever believes there's a chance it would pass, they have to call it. Well, guess what, folks? They haven't called it. Because it's very difficult. Because of the way the Irish government is set up, the Northern Irish government set up. Just to summarize, no, that is not how colonialism works. If the question of United Ireland was actually to be settled, they should have left and had the Irish vote as a whole island, whether they wanted British help. Who? It's factually wrong to suggest they ever accepted a non-United Ireland. They accepted the Good Friday Agreement as a peace treaty. They never had an option in that referendum to say, no, I want a United Ireland. And the certainly the whole island did not. Only the Jerry Mantred part really mattered there. Third, due to the political concessions that the British got in the Good Friday Agreement, once again, because they were more powerful party, it is very difficult in this political context to call for a United Ireland as a referendum. Even when now the border polls are showing a majority. Bri Ireland and as this conversation started, free fucking Palestine.",

Because just yesterday, Israel unilaterally broke the so-called ceasefire that started two months ago. And already more than 400 Palestinians are suspected to have been murdered by them. If you claim Irish heritage as an American, it is almost certain that your ancestors left Ireland because of British colonial violence. So if you are not out crying against the violence of colonialism we see today, what does your heritage mean to you? What do you mean when you say your Irish? Because it doesn't represent the lived experience of your ancestors. And it certainly doesn't align with what a lot of Irish people feel today, who are still occupied by the Brits. I personally am not Irish, but my ancestors were. They were kicked out of Northern Ireland due to colonial violence. They escaped a plantation in Northern Ireland, at least according to family lore. And it is that story, that identity, that heritage that calls on me and many other people who claim this heritage in America to identify with the violence that is being placed against the Palestinians. It is unconscionable to ignore that heritage while the same violence is playing out today. And while we're on the subject, they said the same shit about the Irish as they said about the Palestinians. They said they were a backwards, animalistic, religious to the core, horrible peoples that needed to be tamed. They justified extraordinary violence against the Irish, stole their land, enslaved their people, and called it liberation, called it civilization. And they are doing the same thing today. Israel's playbook is not new. And if you are unwilling or unable to recognize in your own history how that playbook was played against you, it's going to keep being played again. It's dangerous. Show the fuck up. Or shut the fuck up.",

And if you afford them, no matter if you attack civilians, you are not. Reminder, the Mujahideen who later became the Taliban were paid for by America and applauded by them. It's not like they weren't attacking civilians during that time. It's like they were just attacking the civilians America wanted them to. Saddam Hussein, equally maintained power because of America. Not a terrorist when we loved them, a terrorist the second we didn't. So yes, Trump's usage of the word domestic terror to refer to like anyone is not new.

The first reason is that it's like saying, I don't hate Americans. I just hate America. Which would be what? Accurate. I do hate America. I don't hate Americans, although they can be really loud at points. I don't hate Indians. I just don't think that India should do whatever it can to get its hostages back from the neighboring country that purposefully went in and kidnapped innocent civilians. So in order to not hate a certain group, not only do I have to agree with its state, but I also have to give that state carte blanche any actions to defend itself. Because you don't limit that. You say anything to get hostages back. Because let's be clear, you do then hate Palestinians because they can't do anything to get their hostages from Israel back. This is nonsense, right? Because you don't, number one, have to support the country to support the people. Because states are political manifestations that are meant to represent political will, but especially in Israel's case, don't. And second of all, you don't have to believe that that political manifestation should be able to do whatever it wants, especially when that whatever it wants involves genocide. So no, it truly so wild to these fascist exionists to believe that like denying nationalism as a concept means denying like their individual existence and human rights. That's fucking insane.",

But like, Jesus Christ, the idea that the moral bar is a trade embargo or blockade and not like actually ending the genocide going on in Israel is fucking insane.

Find people that will show up on the doorsteps every single day to talk about it. Because if we let them get away with this one, they will and are doing more forced disappearances. And it doesn't fucking matter that he was a green card holder. They don't have the right to deport him, factually.

The fact that 10 of them, of them the Senate Minority Leader, voted to pass a continuing resolution that would allow Trump's fascistic takeover of America is insane. And following that, we need to build our own power. Still, we should try and obstruct the Democrats and the Republicans from doing more and more evil shit, but we should stop relying on them. And what that looks like is turning local. And I hate to say, guys, I know I say too much, but join mutual aid organizations and mutual defense organizations. The military and police will only get more and more called upon against civilians. And the social safety net that liberals have sucked off Republicans to get for the past 70 years will slowly be more and more decayed. So we need organizations that can defend our communities against those militaristic fascists and still eat. And that just does look like local mutual aid organizations. So please do this right now. Look up mutual aid organization where you live. And then contact them. See when their next meeting is and join.

It is incredibly important that we purge that language from now what we are trying to develop. So no, it's not politically neutral to keep a scientific term named after a fascist.

Intent, it doesn't, and the only reason you're thinking about this is because corporations have spent a really long time normalizing the idea that just because these people have put away, they deserve to be enslaved. And in fact, if you really care about putting people to justice, you would want to get rid of slavery within our prisons. Because it skews the whole entire idea of justice. It, imminently and infinitely, pushes the justice system to put more and more and more people in prison. Rather than actually find out who is guilty and who is not, which leads to less resources actually providing justice. I always find this argument interesting because what it actually is is an appeal to absurdity and appeal to emotion. Right? They want you to dehumanize criminals so much that they can do whatever they want with it. Even if the reason that they want to do these things has nothing to do with the reason you're dehumanizing them. So no, I don't believe in the death penalty, I don't believe in slavery.

So I understand how it is compelling to want to just say, look, we recognize they were wrong, but we're not going to change the language because it's difficult. But that ignores the actual harm that is done by continuing to use this vernacular in the actual practice. Because as long as these names continue and are associated with helpful and good things, they can rebuild their image. And you leave room for apologists like you saw in this comment section who denied that they were fascists or harmful in the first place.",

And for those of you who don't know, this symbol is the symbol that the Nazis had queer, trans, gay people sew onto their suits, sew onto their clothes in camps. It was the marker for that being the reason they were in the camps. This is a Nazi symbol and it has the same meaning today as it did then. And there's truly no debate about this. I genuinely don't care what Republicans have to say about it. If you want to say that it has some different meaning today, you should have known what it actually meant. If you want to say he didn't mean it, he should have taken two seconds and mean it. But this is not an accident. This went through multiple people and it was intentional. He is trying to signal for a genocide against queer people. And we need to take him at that word and treat him for what he is, which is a fascist calling for mass genocide. This is where the discussion online ends. An action in person organizing mutual aid community building and direct action starts. Because no longer can we have civil discussion. We were well past having civil discussion with people that are willing to call for our end to existence. We must start building power, which is the only language they understand.",

He was torn away from his family from his wife who is eight months pregnant from his legal residency without due process and without even being accused of a proper crime. The focus right now is to make sure that Mammud Khalil gets free. Absolutely. But we must remember in the political context, this is the fascist testing us. Will we tolerate one disappearance because once we tolerate one, the next and the next and the next just get to be day events rather than actually mobilizing events? Can they anesthetize us to the pain? And as one of my mutuals said, where is your red line? If your red line was political disappearances, it has been passed. And if your red line wasn't, how much further do they have to show their real face? We have to get mobilizing or this will become the norm.",

I realize I haven't said that yet on this platform, so I just want to make my position incredibly clear. I think that sex work, like other types of labor, should be decriminalized and we should work for the liberation of all laborers, including sex workers. I think there are interesting discussions and needed discussions about the way that gendered, racial and class oppression affect sex workers particularly. But at no end of that discussion will it ever be to criminalize any part of that transaction? There's no real good hook to this. I just think it's important that it's said, and I think it's important that I set the Overton window very clearly on my page. That like sex workers are going to be the core of workers' liberation because they already have to live in conditions that are subversive to capital. It is very easy for Petit Boujwa's people to beat down on sex workers even though they claim to be for the workers, and I will not accept that with any workers' movement. It is wrong, it is reactionary, it is harmful. Sex workers are part of the workers' movement and they always have been and always will be. In an ideal world, it wouldn't happen just like all other labor relations would fundamentally change. The way we get rid of coercive sexual practices within this country is by removing the ability to have hyper-powered dynamics like you have within capitalism. So if you want more discussions about this, I'm happy to talk about it. Leave comments with questions.",

    "text": "We think about radical action and groding class solidarity with an America. I think it's very important we remember that America is and has been a slave state. We have more slaves today than any other time in American history, including prior to the abolition of slavery. Of course, the people I'm talking about are what we nicely call prisoners. This issue should be a unifying movement for all workers, because it harms all of us. If you are in a union for a manufacturing good, having slave labor competing against you makes your labor worth less. Do you think there is a chance that you will ever be homeless, ever be disabled, ever be oppressed for your racial, sexual, or gender identity? Then having the risk of that costing you your freedom and the value of your labor should be enough for you to have empathy for the people that it already has been stolen from. So as we're thinking about this, it's not enough for our discussions of prisons to be that it has been corrupted by capital. We must censor the idea that the prisons are a function of capital. That means they are not bad as a side note. The reason they were created and maintained as they are is because it weakens workers. And if we engage in the dehumanization of prisoners, i.e. maintain any form of carceral state in America, we are harming ourselves. What that material looks like while we're building class movements is including and engaging with issues of carceralization, not accepting the status quo of having slaves working in America, reminding everyone that that works like that. And anyone who's sent to prison not even have a second of hesitation that it's wrong unless they're like a fascist. Even then, they should be left to the streets.",

I received disability accommodations because of them. I saw friends be able to go to college because of them. This is not about states rights. This is about my fucking right to education. This is not about giving money back to states. This is allowing children not to be affected by where their parents live to get an equal and fair education. And this is coming from a wealthier white cis man with not that severe of a disability. But most people don't know what the Department of Education does so they don't know how mad to be. So I'll tell you, you should be fucking pissed. The idea that these people want to tear down the Department of Education is beyond fascist not wanting education. It's fucking evil because what it will mean is we return to a system where if you are rich and white in America you get a much much much much much better public education than any other person. We already have that but the Department of Education is about all we have to prevent just the worst conceivable version of that. Just to address the preemptive bullshit. This is not a state's rights issues. States rights are enshrined in the Constitution and they have full jurisdiction over education. All the Department of Education does is help the states be better at education and fund poorer ones. It helps states rights. This isn't about lowering bureaucracy. You know what's a lot more bureaucratic than one central federal agency? 50 state agencies. This is not about equity or getting rid of DEI. Fuck you actually. I'm not even going to address that point. If you don't like DEI, I don't like you. But yeah, you should be fucking pissed about this. I'm fucking pissed about this. What little good our federal government did do is slowly being robbed from us. And quite honestly this is hard to respond to because education should be done on a high level systemic front. It can't easily be responded to with intra community care. But what you can do is within your community, if there are people struggling, you can stand up for them. If there are people that will go without lunch, now without this program, put together co-ops to provide lunch. We must respond as a community because we know for damn sure the Democrats in the fucking capital won't.",

    "text": "We're a leftist and you care about women, why are you calling out radical Islam? Two reasons. First of all, the right has me covered. Second of all, because radical Islam is not in power where I live and where it is in power, it's because where I live invaded that place. This is what we call co-opting feminism in leftism for imperialist aims. So let's break it down. This argument tends to take two forms. You call out America for being oppressive, why do you call out Iran for being oppressive? That's the foreign one, and then the domestic is you call out Christian evangelicals for being wrong, dogmatic, and hating on women, why do you call out Muslims that say the same thing? And I think they have a fundamental similarity in the issue, which is they misplace who has the power and why. Leftists are ultimately concerned with power. And when we see, for example, Iran or Iraq or Syria having radical extreme Muslims in power, typically the wrongs that that occurs in is because of a reaction to colonialism. For example, with Iran, why don't I call out the IRGC? Well, because the IRGC almost certainly wouldn't be in power, but for American imperialism. So if I can prevent more American imperialism, ding ding ding ding, I can stop the reactionary radical religiosity, which happens all the time. It's only expected if you bomb people to shreds for a very long time or keep wiping out their democratically elected leaders, like we did with Mosodeg and Iran, they're going to have to unite around something, and that something isn't going to be Western values. Also, there's a huge amount of misinformation about the treatment of women in those countries, and I would much, much, much, much, much rather address the issues within America, and the issues of stopping America from doing evil shit there, then engage in arguments that could conceivably enable America to do more evil shit. The final response to the foreign argument, I would say, is I have no fucking control over it. Who cares what a Westerner, a white American, says about Iran? The only reason it's relevant is if you think intervention into Iran would be justified, which I never will, because that's evil. Second of all, that moves to the domestic. Okay, so you don't care what Iran's doing, why are you calling out Muslim leaders here? And I think that's really, really simple. How many Muslim leaders are elected into Congress? How many, how many Congress people have said that America should be a Muslim country? That is a grand total of zero. Muslims in America are an oppressed minority objectively. I don't really care if an oppressed minority have bad political takes, because they can't really enforce them. And to the point where that affects me personally, or we're talking about individual cases, I will ascribe it individual harms, but systemically, it's not really possible for Islam, per se, to be an oppressive force within America, because they simply don't have the power to do so. And my favorite thing about this is I started my platform being critical of religion, and I'm happy to be critical of Islam as a religion, just as I am Christianity as a religion, and Judaism, and Bah\u00e1'\u00ed and like all of them, I don't like religions. It's often a laughable misconception, but that's why leftists don't engage with critiquing Islam like fucking far-right fascists do all the time, because they're only unable, those far-right fascists to advocate stupid evil shit.",

You're gonna have to forgive me for taking a joke and taking it seriously, but like someone doing a drag performance to me talking about how someone shooting at a CEO is cool and scary to the ruling class is both awesome but also like informative. Because these spaces where radical thought, which is objectively what like shooting at a CEO is, is not only normal but also so normal that doing a performance about it gets you like audience engagement. There's no argument. There's no debate. There's no engagement. That just is the space. And as we're thinking about like building mutual aid networks, building community in America, we are very nihilistic guys. It's not looking good. But there are spaces. There is community in America. It does exist. We need to build off of it and learn from it. And a mutual of mine Evan, I'll tag them below as well as the drag king that did that. I'll tag below. We're talking about the rave spaces within America and how that is a core place for leftists to meet and organize. And that's real! Like that's very real. Rave spaces are a radical place. Gay bars can be a radical space. In my experience, some not like leftist, far leftist radicalizing spaces, but space with cool places, a unitary and universalist churches. All of these spaces exist and in your communities, you should go out and find what spaces exist where radical thought is acceptable, welcomed and built upon. Because that is how you meet people to go do cool things with. And once cool things happen, that is what communities we go back to to be housed, be hid, be fed. Like where can you do a drag performance about a CEO being shot? That's who's going to house you when, maybe you'd do it. By the way, that drag performance went on to have a great rendition and dance to another one bites the dust. The drag king's name is Chip Philae and they're tag below.",

    "text": "It is incredibly difficult for me to watch liberal politicians celebrate International Women's Day today. Call for change for gender relations. Call for gendered rights when they are consistently ignoring the plight and brutalization of women and others within Palestine and other occupied territories. They will call out the brutality of the Republicans denying abortion. Call out the brutality of them, lowering child marriage laws. But then when it is done in Israel, when women are murdered in cold blood, that is just the cost of doing business. This is Shereen Abu Aqle, a Palestinian-American who was murdered in cold blood for the crime of being a journalist in the West Bank. She was covering the brutality of Israel in the West Bank, and then she became a victim of that exact brutality. Israel claimed that them shooting her was a mistake, but third party evidence showed that it was a targeted direct attack. It is incredibly difficult for me to see the liberal politicians call out the brutality of the Republicans to women and completely ignore the women that have been murdered by Israel, murdered with American weapons and American bombs, and failing to even call out the most flagrant direct attack on journalistic integrity and the freedom of women within West Bank. And so today we should absolutely be celebrating the accomplishments for of and by women. But it is impossible to separate the gendered struggle for liberation from the other struggles for all liberation, be that from imperialism, colonialism, racial apartheid, etc. And I do not take seriously any politician that is calling out for change in gendered relations, but is unwilling or unable to engage in their own part of oppression. So happy International Women's Day that doesn't just mean wearing pink in Congress, that means fighting for the fucking resistance.",

But let's let him say what the dictionary definition is, and then just look at the dictionary. What fucking definition are you looking at? I don't know where Theodore Herzl wrote the Holocaust into his works in like the 1800s. But let's get the definition up. Here's the definition from Oxford Languages, a real dictionary guy, Shadow Talksford. A movement for originally the reestablishment, now the development and protection of a Jewish nation. So you got that part, right? In what is now Israel? It was established as a political organization in 1897. By my count that's before the Holocaust, Under Theodore Herzl later as Shane Fysman. So the first guy was roughly correct, not mainly European Jews, but it was by European Jews. But it was for the establishment of a Jewish nation, so in the place he wanted to go back to the ancestral homeland. And I want you all to note a few things about this little interaction. First of all, the guy that like gave the answer gave a Zionist answer, presupposing that it is an ancestral homeland that they are returning to is a Zionist talking point. You can debate whether it's true or not, but that is starting out a moderate Zionist talking point. That's to set the overton window. This is the moderate kind of dumb college zone position and this is the expert position. But second of all, the guy that asked the question and then said the definition didn't even pretend to give a fuck about reality, right? Like clearly, the dictionary definition is not what he said. But when he says, do you not have the dictionary definition on you, that is to impeach the witness, that is to immediately make you think, oh, the guy asked the question, knows better than this guy. And so I'm going to believe the smarter person in the video. So let's think about what he did. He found a person who gave a moderate Zionist answer to shift the overton window here. And then he said, that's dumb. You don't know the dictionary definition. Here's the dictionary definition, the extreme, flagrantly wrong answer I've given. So that everyone views this as the smarter and more center answer. So I know, I mean, they're liars. He's lying. This is a propaganda show. We're beyond recognizing that he's lying. What he's doing is actively trying to shift the overton window so that you, even if you kind of think he's lying, are shifted here so that you're only comfortable going back here, maybe to the other guy's answer, which is still a moderate Zionist position. That's it entirely. They're fucking liars.",

You weren't allowed to look at their children as children, and that's why I was okay for Israel to do things. You couldn't have empathy for gay and lesbian people dying of HIV. They deserved it. You couldn't have empathy for trans women using bathrooms. You had empathy for the cis women that felt uncomfortable because another woman was in the bathroom. The question is never how the trans women feels. It's how every other woman there feels. The question about gay people existing is never how they feel about their marriage. It's about how straight people tolerate that marriage. But now being flipped, the question isn't whether the CEO was a person and how their family will feel. That's really what the media wants you to feel. It's how did the working class feel? How did it feel to have cancer treatments denied? You can have empathy for the working class, but our empathy will be limited for the ruling class. They kind of brought it on themselves. And I don't think the important discussion here right now is whether he deserved or not in specific instances. I think we're all in agreement there. But I think it's important to note that no longer does he get the political empathy that has been forced upon us, merely because of his position. No longer can we buy the media saying we should care about this CEO dying way more than the women and children that have to not take medicine in our country because they can't afford it. The thousands that go without treatment. The thousands that die over decades because they go without treatment. No more do we give a fuck about them? And we're gonna laugh when they spend 10 news cycles talking about this and not a single news cycle talking about the other thing. If you have empathy for him as a human, great. And I do too, right? But the point here is that the empathy we're talking about is political and it has switched from being political for the benefit of the ruling class to finally the working class, recognizing our empathy for each other. And ultimately that should be the focus.",

    "text": "Why the fuck does Trump not like Ukraine? Well, it's because it's not America. To understand this, we need to go back a little bit. Biden and a bunch of other liberals, and pretty much every conservative as well, viewed America as the headgemon of the world. We own the world. And if you run the world, and your whole system is built on that idea, you can't lose a war. You certainly can't be seen to lose a war. So if you are about to be seen to lose a war, like we would in Ukraine, number one, you just keep fucking fighting. And number two, you just make it a frozen conflict, like we did with Georgia and eventually Cyprus. And Israel, guys. I.E., you never let them annex the territory, but you lose, and you let them kind of take the economic resources of the territory, saves your ego as a country, lets them win, actually. But if you are a nation among nations, which is how Trump envisions America, you can lose, right? Because then you're trading between equals, and then you can trade off bits of territory for your benefit, you can trade in material minerals, goals from Ukraine. Do you see how those are two different things? And that's not entirely explanatory. I mean, lots and lots is going on here, and Trump is being Putin's little bitch. I mean, that's accurate. There are also smart, self-interested people behind Trump, and Trump has a different conception of America, not as the headgemonic superpower, but as an empire self-interested in itself, not its allies, not its vassal states, right? But itself, as Americans, nationalism, rather than an empire running the world. And in that way, you can lose a war, or at the very least, the way you win a war is by getting the most out of it as possible, which is what Trump's doing.",

I've seen way too many of these videos watching RC just absolutely ran into the point, and picking on easy targets for no reason. And what point you may ask? The point is that we are suggesting that people are erasing women from history, and then RC responds by erasing the women contribution from history. Like notice how we only responded to three, and then when he responds he failed to mention the obvious contribution that that woman actually did have. So while I agree they're an easy target, they're stating things that are slightly true, unclear, unprecise. RC is being overly pedantic and obviously missing the point. So let's try and make this a little harder for him. RC, who invented the disposal diaper? Or the appgar method, which is the test that they use to make sure that your baby is healthy and doing okay. That seems important. Or the inventor of Kevlar, you know the thing that is used in bulletproof vests? Be as pedantic as you want. There are many contributors to all of these things. And when we're talking about these things, we're talking about all of the contributions and highlighting women's contributions because of people like you that will take any conceivable opportunity to ignore women's contributions to them. And when you respond and cut around the obvious and clear contributions, to make a pedantic point about how a man also contributed or a man was the final beneficiary, you're proving the point that there are people that actively work to embrace women from history, precisely like you're doing.",

    "text": "According to mainstream media, Luigi made 20 tapes. Time first used that media literacy we've been building. As far as I'm concerned, he probably didn't, it doesn't matter if he did. But let's try and think about why the media would care about this story, whether it's true or not. If you are a wealthy individual in America and the working class that you have stolen from four years, suddenly rallied behind someone who allegedly committed violence against wealthy people like you, you would want to diminish the support that they received, not as support for their actions allegedly because they've never been proven. But as support for him being hot, you would want to demean him to a sex symbol rather than a revolutionary icon, which is hilarious because you know what people would like even more than a revolutionary icon, a revolutionary sex symbol. So the goal here is to say no, no, no, no, no, no. You working class people thought you were uniting around being working class, no, no, no, silly, some of y'all were just horny, right? And look, look, people are looking for their tapes, it was just horne-ness. You don't actually have any power. But that's not the reality. First of all, we can be two things, horny and frustrated. But second of all, look at the social media reactions, prior to finding out how hot the alleged shooter was. It was the same. This is nonsense. So anyone trying to claim it's just a sex symbol, it's bullshit. And on these tapes, if they exist, don't look at them. It's fucking unethical. We have enough to enjoy just from the court pictures.",

    "text": "Keep hearing the people of power, but what power do we really have? This is what I keep hearing from everyone. We feel frustrated and angry, but what can we do? And for that, I have some examples. The most prescient example I think of habitually is the Black Panthers. And I know scary word guys, but calm down. For educational purposes, let's look at what the Black Panthers did that had a real impact on people's lives. They had two major programs and a lot more, but two major that I'll focus on, which is copwatch and three clinics and breakfast. The first copwatch was the Black Panthers responding to the abuse that Black people got in neighborhood for being overpleased and simply being Black in the neighborhood. And so, community members got rifles and started following the cops, to self-defense their community members from the cops abusing them. This is a highly risky action by the Black Panthers, right? And it did eventually lead to shootouts with the cops when the cops inevitably started abusing civilians. But it also built trust in those neighborhoods that were being patrolled by the Black Panthers of that political project. It built community and it kept the fucking community safe. So while high risk also was effective to its goals. Just as a fun fact, the way they funded those first few rifles was by going to UC Berkeley and selling copies of Mao's little red book to rich students. Leftists are not idealists, we're pragmatists. Get shit done. Now that is a very, very risky program. But the second one they did was not near the Asrisky Black Panthers crack down on just as much roughly, which is their free breakfast and free clinic program. This was a program put together by communities to provide free breakfast so that people could go into work, right, and have more security and take care of children, and feed the unhoused, etc. And free clinics to take care of their community members who were being underfunded and abused by the government that was supposed to be taking care of them. And this serves two purposes once again. It takes care of the community, it builds community, it provides space for people to come together and plan further revolutionary action. And second of all, it moves power towards the people in a way from the government. If you are committing revolutionary action, you can't be dependent on SNAP. That would be the first thing that goes. So it provided community security to build real actual power to resist when the government was doing harmful things. There are hundreds of other examples throughout history of revolutionary organizations using this structure. Risky, unrisky, legal to illegal actions, building community around the goal of protecting the community and providing real actual results. And that doesn't mean we copy verbatim what they've done. I don't think a party is possible nowadays, considering what happened to the Black Panthers from the CIA illegally going after them. But I do think when we're thinking about how to build power, people have done this before, people have won, people have fought, people have revolted, and they have strategies, they've written books on it, right. So you don't need to be a theory nerd to think about these things, but I would say let's sit and learn from our history and all try and make it as entertaining as possible. Because we are not the first to fight fascists and we will not be the last. But we can be one of the ones that win. For legal purposes, this is just educational. I do not advocate anything the Black Panthers did, and I'm merely educating people on how to engage and build community for legal, productive, non-seversive, pro-state activity alone. I love you, the state of the United Kingdom, and I love you the state of the US. I love you CIA, I love you FBI, NSA. You're my daddy. Love you.",

It increases in tempo the whole time, until people stand up and start clapping. Very common propaganda technique makes you feel emotions because of the music in the background that you then connect to the message, classic brainwashing. Second of all, you notice what she's equivocating there? Some bad men. You know what makes those men bad? Often that they are abusing, essaying and having unconsensual intercourse, right? Horse, well, I can't say the word, but you know what I mean? Against women, who are their wives? That's what they're doing. And then the sin that would be equivalent for women is manipulation or being unfaithful, which often is done in defense to, what is it? The thing the men are doing. Third, she's saying women aren't submitting to men because they're a some bad men. You're just mixing up the arguments. Now, I've been known to do my fair share for submitting to men, but Jesus Christ, that's not why women aren't submitting to men. It's because it's a fucking bad thing to do in general, in society, politically. Women are human beings. They should submit to people just as much as men should submit to people, you know, unless they're into that. But finally, and like most ridiculous, she's a woman, preaching in churches, telling men what to do. Like, if you actually believed this, you would follow very clearly what's in Timothy and women shall not preach in churches. They shall have a meek spirit. Like, what do you mean? Like, okay. What do you mean? What do you mean? I don't think in order to be a Christian, you have to be misogynistic. I'm not a Christian. I don't, I think women should be able to preach in churches. I think that's a great thing. But I do think in order to be a misogynistic Christian, you have to be misogynistic. What the fuck?",

    "text": "I agree. Riding isn't possible when people are starving on the streets. And this is what a lot of people don't understand about the connection between direct action and mutual aid. They are not possible without each other. Or the very least not as relevant. Mutual aid is so that people can get to the point that they can do direct action, effective direct action, and so that when they do it, they can be fed and housed and clothed and hidden. And so the first step of any leftist movement historically is to build mutual aid networks so that when direct resistance actions are taken against fascistic governments, the people that take them don't immediately get caught and destroyed. And so that there are enough people with enough physical ability to take them. That is why doing things like mutual aid and revolutionary is because they enable revolution. They're not done in the context of them, they're not. But there can be contexts where feeding your neighbor is revolutionary. Go knock on their door. Talk to them. Get to know them. See if you need something to fix or if they need something fixed. Find new clinics of health. Do pre-breakfasts. These type of places are not only places that revolutionaries can meet each other and plan actions that are direct plan riots, plan protests. But they're also places that if those things happen, they can fall back on the people they met there. And the networks that are built there.",

We aren't breaking into the factory and destroying the things that were produced because we were promised that if we striked, the police wouldn't do the violence against us. But the second they break that pact, we break ours. Many of the civil rights, civil liberties and worker protections that we fought extremely hard for that are being torn down by this administration did not come because people were nice, did not come because society progressed.

You know I know that this is the plan? Because they've done it again and again and again. In the 2008 recession, wealth inequality massively increased. Even though those poor bankers on Wall Street went to the government and begged to be bailed out. That's because those bailouts didn't go to helping the people with debt. Right? That foreclosed on their houses. Thousands of people lost their houses. It went to the capitalists who owned the bank. Tariffs are already a preemptory bailout for the companies. They have served the consumer and they hurt the government. Right? They harm the relations that two governments have with each other and they harm the consumer because we pay them. You know who benefits? The corporations in America that now don't have to compete with the rest of the world. So yeah, this will harm the working class massively but I don't want us to sit and laugh at Trump for how stupid it is to have a harm the economy. That's his goal. He doesn't care about the economy.

We all know what they're talking about with delusion and false narrative. Trans people, gay people, DEI. There are too much whims to come out and say and why is that? What are they trying to do here? I think they're trying to do two things. First of all, divert the argument that is very natural going on. We're looking at Trump and saying, guys, I thought you loved the economy. I thought we were too obsessed with social issues and you just wanted the economy good. That's what you kept telling us. And now that Trump's economy is going to shit, right? Why aren't you turning on him? I thought you only liked his economy. And they're saying no, no, no, it's not about that, right? It's actually about just this other disagreement, I guess. So the first response, the first goal is to silence that very real argument that is the natural conclusion of their rhetoric. The second one, delusion, false narrative. That's a dog whistle. Delusion specifically is a dog whistle to transgender people, right? They're saying you lost because you accepted that trans people are valid. But they're saying it in a way that if we, people that believe trans people have rights, engage in that discussion from that point, we look like the social issue obsessed people. When, in fact, that post is re-centering social issues. So either way, we lose. If we don't engage, they're transphobic and get to divert the point. If we do engage, they're proving the point from their previous rhetoric. That's because this post isn't meant to be critical. It's not meant to have an argument. It's not meant to be discourse. The goal of this post is to silence. Either silence people that are calling them on their bullshit from before, or silence people that are calling them on their bullshit now.

See where I'm going here? It's at this link, and it's really easy to fill out. And I would hate the moms for liberty people who are looking over it, to have to look through a bunch of data, and have to guess which was real and which was fake, and I would hate for them to have to read things that they didn't like. So, I would absolutely hate. If anyone, especially those with coding expertise, send in fake, untrue information to this very official, important government institution to protect against DEI. And I would really hate if those people used things like guerrilla mail where they can't track whose email it is, but you can receive emails back from it, so that you can follow back up with their very important work. I would really hate if a bunch of these came from Republican areas, so they thought that all of this DEI stuff wasn't happening in California and New York. That I would hate, and I would really, really hate if this had to be shut down, because too many meddling leftists online stopped this nasty shit from being allowed.",

That wants to physically kill him. Not Hamas. No, no, no, no. Not the ICC, which is literally inditing him in like half the world. No, no, no. It's this mother who is literally a fucking fascist who voted for the LaKoud party. It's like fills me with rage, right? Because no, what the fuck? People have died trying to go against Netanyahu's genocidal party. And the people that are peaceful protesting from within Israel get on the prop? Fuck you. No, that's disrespectful and it's dishonest. But I have to sit back and say, okay, this is propaganda. What is this propaganda trying to do? And what it is trying to do is tell you not to believe in violent protest. To believe the myth that peaceful protest just being really angry from the inside will change policy. It won't. It never has. If she was his fiercest foe, why hasn't he gone after her? When he's very happy to kill his other political opponents, if as long as they're in occupied territories, why hasn't she gotten shit done? This went on for 16 months and now they're back at war. Why did nothing change? Because it doesn't fucking work. But of course, New York Times, which is a liberal-ass fucking propaganda outlet, wants you to believe that the status quo, I know it has its issues, but it can be changed through the status quo institutions. I know we are committing violence against you. I know Netanyahu is literally putting your son at risk, but just ask me nicely and maybe I'll kill them slightly less. Because they don't believe that the violence they're doing against you is equivalent, right, to the violence that would be done against them. They believe violent protest is so much worse, and the only difference between violent protest, right, and the violence they're doing is one is the status quo and one threatens the status quo. So while this propaganda like physically makes me want to die, holy shit, because it's so wrong, the reason they're doing it is very important. They are lying because they are fucking scared of what happens if they don't, which is people realizing that when someone does violence against you, the only actual solution, right, is to respond in kind.",

Once again proving that you may be able to negotiate with terrorists, but you can never negotiate with colonizers. Now do not read that as me diminishing the gravity of the disgusting act Israel has just done. Because across the board people were very happy to see the ceasefire happen. The immediate rush of humanitarian aid is needed. But it is important to note that this is neither an aberration or really a surprise because Israel as a colonizing occupying force centers their whole political project on expanding and maintaining oppression of a minority class. If they don't have that, they have nothing. And especially Netanyahu, who is the peak of this right now, relies on continued violence. And they're relying on you being tired from the fascism growing in America, being tired from the year and a half of this happening, and not caring enough as the news barrage is in. But we, and the Palestinians certainly, cannot afford that to be true. So Israel is declaring war again. We must as well. We need to speak about Israel. We need to help gossens and we need to have outrage showing everyone that this will not stand. So don't forget about Palestinians and don't forget that America is complicit in this genocide just as much as it always has been.",

And beyond that, they fail to remember that a huge portion of the DRC is Christian. So there's 70 Christians that have died are some of a few million that are being murdered, right? With American weaponry. And it feels very crass to kind of sit and laugh because these are very difficult topics, right? And what is happening in the Congo is truly utterly despicable. But I'm not laughing about that, right? Because I actually advocate for the solution to that, which is to America to stop funding and working with the Emirates, who are funding it and also stop funding it directly as we literally do. I'm not fking out the evangelicals that are so incredibly divorced from reality that they think some people dying in the DRC who happen to be Christian represents them in America being oppressed. And beyond them thinking this, they use that as some form of political angle of them being oppressed when their cult leader, Donald Trump, is now becoming the dictator of the United States. It truly boggles the mind. And I think a lot more work, especially on the left to side, needs to be put into understanding and responding to like how deeply evangelicalism has warped reality in America.",

The reason people feel like they need to vote for something that is objectively different than the system, which fascism is guys, is because they feel like the system is leaving them no other options. Conservatives, liberals, they're doing the same thing. And those voters are right, that's what we need to learn. They're absolutely correct. Democrats and Republicans are not exactly the same, but they're reinforcing the same system. Tories and labor reinforcing the same system. And we see the problems with that. We see the frustrations. We see the issues that systems creating. And fascists just offer something fucking different. And at some point, it doesn't matter what that different thing is. So if we want to respond to fascists, we need to provide something different that's not insanely heinously evil. And that has always been and will always be something on the left, whether that's socialism, that's actually effective or communism. We need to provide real actual options or people will choose the only other option they have.",

    "text": "Why should leftist B. Antinationalist if nationalism is such a potent anti-colonial force, like in the pro-Palestinian movement in the Vietnamese movement? This is a very real question, because many very effective liberation movements had a national identity at their core. But here's my general view on it. They are potent and effective because they are responding and interfacing with the system you're trying to take down. They are inherently reactionary in so far as they are nationalist. Let's break that down a little bit. My assertion is that the reason nationalist movements have been effective for liberation is not because nationalism per se is the effective push, but because it interfaces with the systems that those who are in charge of the hedgehogs, primarily the global north and the west, believe it. Europe superimposed ideas of nationalism upon everyone in the world. And they also created places like the UN, they also created the international community, which has the language of nationalism built into it. So if you want to liberate a people, the only language you can use is nationalism. And that's fair and that's true. But that doesn't mean that it's nationalism that's effective. And it actually means that nationalism as a system should be rejected except to be used extremely facetiously and tactically in engaging with European and Western systems like the international community. And this is quite clear because people's nationality was not the most important part of their identity very often prior to European colonialism. Be it the tribe, the family, the religion, the ethnicity, the culture, right, whatever, there were many other identities that they cared about a lot more other than a nationality. The only reason we saw the development of national liberation movements was in response and in relation most importantly to the European system. So TLDR, you're correct in observing that national liberation movements have been effective. That is not the same thing as saying we should accept nationalism as a good proposition. The reason they've been effective is because that proposition is powerful. It's because nationalism is built into our communities, into our world system, right? But that is begging the question. You are observing that only the people that speak the language of nationalism get what they want. But that doesn't mean that nationalism is a good thing and it doesn't mean our world system should be built that way.",

The point is that we are suggesting that people are erasing women from history, and then RC responds by erasing the women contribution from history.

So while I agree they're an easy target, they're stating things that are slightly true, unclear, unprecise. RC is being overly pedantic and obviously missing the point. So let's try and make this a little harder for him. RC, who invented the disposal diaper? Or the appgar method, which is the test that they use to make sure that your baby is healthy and doing okay. That seems important. Or the inventor of Kevlar, you know the thing that is used in bulletproof vests? Be as pedantic as you want. There are many contributors to all of these things. And when we're talking about these things, we're talking about all of the contributions and highlighting women's contributions because of people like you that will take any conceivable opportunity to ignore women's contributions to them.

    "text": "Well, no nationalism is counter-revolutionary, right? There's a reason that the vast majority of revolutionary leftists in the world have rejected nationalism its entirety. Let's go back in history and explain that. The modern form of nationalism that we work with right now is romantic nationalism, which is not so much a political ideology as it is a kind of vibe if you want to think about it that way. It doesn't really matter if the story being told is true. It doesn't actually matter that Germans are not descendant of Arians. It doesn't actually matter that Italians aren't descendant of whatever they made up. Right? What matters is that it makes you feel that good. Right? Oh, you go to the hills of Bavaria and you feel German. Right? I go to Kitty Hawk Dunes and I feel American. And that's what the political entity and ideology is based on. And this really started historically with Napoleon and he was faced with an issue. The issue that he was faced with was I have a revolution that won't stop. And all these revolutionaries know how to do one thing, revolt. And he realized that they need to turn the revolution outwards. Right? So he said, hey revolutionaries, you need to stop killing each other. We're all French. We're better than everyone because of this made up story. Let's go kill everyone else. Let's take their stuff. Let's make them French. Because we deserve to rule. And it shut down the revolution. Turned it outwards. And Americans do the exact same thing. Right? Always notice how Americanism is used to justify invading other countries. Is used to justify committing violence against non-Americans. Never ever used to justify committing violence against people that do violence against Americans. Right? You see what I mean? When CEOs line their pockets by killing thousands, it's un-American to kill them. Right? But when someone has made up weapons, mass destruction, the most American thing you can do is kill three million Iraqi women and children. And that's because this is a hollow idea. Americanism doesn't really exist. I mean, people feel American, but that feeling can be poured into any political aim that you want. And it, by definition, of being aligned with the state, is going to be poured into the state's interests, not the people's interests. So if we're trying to build revolution, one of the first steps is to reject the tools of those trying to prevent revolution. And nationalism just is one of those tools.",

There's this unfortunate tendency, especially when trying to raise the alarm bells about fascism, to have the response beat that you are fear mongering, or that you are overstating the threat of fascism. And that, for one part, is very valid, because we want to respect the harms and dangers of fascism and not have a way that calls wolf moment. But 10 times out of 10, it is better to be more wary of fascism and fissistic tendencies than to be too late. And second of all, it tends to come out of a misunderstanding of what fascism is and where it's coming from. The anti-communist push that happened in America and in the West, right, for the past fucking 70, 80 years, not only has, like, fermented the new fascist movements, but directly funded it in certain cases, such as when America funded far right wing militias and dictatorships in the global south. That's America funding fascism, guys. So my point, kind of, divorce from reform, is that we should be super wary about the rise of fascism. Not only is it, certainly, unequivocally, on the rise in the United Kingdom with reform and with Tommy Robinson, et cetera, it is on the rise as the West moves away from this kind of liberal order that is breaking apart. And we should be super, super vigilant about it and super vigilant to give it zero power.",

It was the communists that killed the most fascists and sacrificed the most to kill the fascists. So I'm not saying the USSR was good bad ugly, whatever. What I am saying is that following fascism, people knew what actually stopped it and supported the ideology that actually fought against fascism. And my god where they proven right. Because later, as we go into the Cold War, it is the fascists and the liberals that buttied up to fight against leftism and communism. Habitually, you're often taught in history that America, right, later in the Cold War, throughout the world, supported anti-communist struggles. You know what most of those struggles were? Far right wing authoritarians, nationalists. They were fascists guys. So what happened very often was communism actually fought fascists and did its own bad things on occasion, right? And then the liberals funded the fascists to counteract the communists. So yeah, liberalism has never worked actually responding to fascism actually prior to like the bombing of Pearl Harbor. America kind of liked the fascists and was very good inspiration for a lot of fascism within Western Europe. Hitler didn't first come after the liberals. He first came after the communist, the Bolsheviks. So how did we defeat fascism? With leftism, with communism. And how did we reinstate it? By fucking liberalism.",

    "text": "American evangelicals have found a new excuse to feel oppressed, and that is by co-opting the oppression of people in the Democratic Republic of Hong Kong. For example, 70 Christians were just beheaded in the Dominican Republic of Kongo, and I just wanted to take a moment to pray for them. That's so interesting, haven't as a fellow 20-year-old, mediumly attracted white man, I question why you haven't been talking about the Christians that were murdered by the IDF, or the Christian sanctuaries that were bombed by the IDF in Palestinian territories, or the destroying of Bethlehem on Christmas Day last year. Or why do you leave out the fact that the organization that did it, the IDF, is aligned with a far-right Christian extremist group in the Congo? Why'd you leave that out? Why'd you leave that out? Right? Like, my point is not that these deaths are not tragic. They are. My point is that they are being leveraged by perverse and often unrecognized political aims. They only find these deaths tragic because they lead into a Christian evangelical narrative of being oppressed worldwide, and generally in line with American foreign policy, because surprise, surprise, it so happens that this Islamist group is not one of the hundreds of Islamist groups that have been funded by the United States military and CIA, and it certainly isn't the IDF, which has killed more Christians than this Islamist group, and destroyed some of the oldest Christian sanctuaries and communities in the world. Why are you not praying for them? And I also swear, I swear this person does not know the organization that murdered these Christians. Or why? Right? Like, I'm not saying it's justified, I'm not saying it's acceptable, but I'm once again merely pointing out that these deaths are convenient for the Christian evangelical movement. It is not that they are actually sad about the deaths, it is that they fit a political narrative, and that is why it is getting the focus. And what's the most tragic about this, at least from like a personal level for that person, is they often don't know they're being used as a political pawn. Many, many American evangelicals genuinely believe and feel the tragedy of these deaths, and that is valid. What is not valid is feeling the tragedy of these deaths, but being entirely calloused to the deaths committed that don't engage your political narrative of oppression and American imperialism.",

But it immediately presupposes that being anti-zyonist and calling anti-semitism are reposed, or at least this is exceptional of that. When the reality is anti-zyonism is calling anti-semitism, because Zionism is an extraordinarily anti-semitic movement. And even if you don't accept that, anti-zyonism is not by any means necessarily anti-semitic or juxtaposed with calling out anti-semitism. Considering that the belief that a people group should have a nation state is completely divorced from how you feel about that people group. But this propaganda does precisely what it's meant to do. Make it impossible to respond to an argument they're making because you don't even realize they're making that argument. You don't even realize, and most people wouldn't, that this statement presupposes that anti-zyonism while not maybe flagrantly anti-semitic is at least accepting, or calling anti-semitism is a thing separate from anti-zyonism. And that, when responding to propaganda, is what we need to be aware of. What arguments aren't they saying? What arguments aren't they admitting they're making? And don't accept any of their idiotic premises that you don't have to.",

These people have used explicitly Nazi language, like Alice for Deutschland, reminiscent of a Nazi slogan actively. They've been endorsed by Elon Musk, a white apartheider who did the Nazi salute in front of America. They've called for re-migration, an explicitly Nazi idea. They've given tickets to immigrants to go back as propaganda, which is something the Nazis did in their original days to Jewish people to Jerusalem. Every time we call out fascism, they will try to gaslight us into believing it is somehow offensive to call them what they are. It is not, we must call them fascists, or else they will get away with it. The AFD are fascists, Trump and his cronies when they do the fucking Nazi salute are fascists. If we can't call them out, we can't combat them. Call them what they are and treat them as they are. This is insane!",

It was the reaction. The reaction they wanted was to detest violence in its obvious, active form, shooting someone, but that's not what was given. The reaction was no fuck, like the healthcare system is giving violence. Why are you condemning that? Right? We can talk about this violence, but fuck, the whole system. When you deny your children healthcare, when you bankrupt someone for having cancer, that's violence. And what's really scary is that the working class unified around that. And so especially as the tide turned more and more for the oligarchs, we need to remember that they are fucking scared, and they wouldn't be scared if we didn't have any power.",

I get a lot of questions about why I talk so much about history on this page that is overtly political. And that is because history is politics. It is impossible to understand either without the other. This is really easy to see even in America where the fertility of soil even affected the distribution of votes in the 2020 election. While you can talk about both history and politics as a matter of ideas and people and events, it is just as much of that as it is a fact of material reality. And so analyzing politics as demonizing individuals or ideas is almost useless when you don't take into account the historical background. And so as we see a rising tide of fascism in America and in Germany and across the Western world, right with reform being more powerful in the UK, it is necessary. And it is almost useless to do political analysis without understanding the historical context for how fascism rises and most importantly, how it is defeated.",

Let's break that down a bit. First of all, communism, at its end state, is an article in that it rejects unjustified hierarchies. Maybe where we're confused is that there are different medium states, right? Different socialism to that communism that take an anarchy approach or take an authoritarian approach. But anarchy and authoritarianism is not left right. I mean, the second of all, extreme left right is communism. That's just the definition. The right versus left spectrum is capitalism and fascism, right? And socialism and communism. If you want to describe it differently, that's fine, right? But you're wrong, at least within colloquial usage. And this is also just wrong once again, by suggesting communism can't be anarchical. It, by definition, as described by Marx, is anarchy. Anarchist individually can have critiques of Marx for certain things he said that's fine, right? But the description of communism in the end state where the state whithers away is like the definition of anarchy, at least within a governmental sense.",

AFD, winning a lot of seats in the Bundestag, is a rise of fascism because it is an increase in the power fascism has. So it is both a rise of fascism and a formalization of the already rise of fascism that has happened. Because fascism is both a political and social phenomenon, right? Political and social. So it being in the Bundestag in the Congress of Germany is political rise. It is also a social rise. And it's mildly infuriating talking to leftists, especially American leftists, who are of the belief that elections or elected officials don't matter at all just because, ultimately, right? They won't sufficiently ever challenge capitalism. That doesn't, that's not the only thing that exists. That's not the only thing that matters. It does matter that you have one calling for the mass deportation and effective genocide of migrants, right? And one that's saying, hey, maybe don't do that. That does matter and that does have an effect. And I don't know that this comment was saying that, but I just want to say, like, we can talk on different scales. The ultimate revolutionary destruction of capitalism, right, is different than the imminent response to certain political aims. And both of these conversations can and should be had. So please, I'm going to talk about elections because they have impacts on real living people, right? Well, also recognizing that there's ultimately only so much that anyone can do with an election, and the ultimate goal with an election is to just prevent the worst of the worst of the worst of the appeasement from happening.",

It should be unconstitutional. And some of the only countries on Earth that do as many death penalties as America does, are Iran, the Taliban, and China. Are those the bedfellows you want your criminal justice system in? Beyond that, it also doesn't work. It's more expensive than life in prison, and it doesn't reduce recidivism rates, meaning it doesn't actually reduce the likelihood of another similar crime happening. So, while we all love this one, and think, you know, he probably didn't do anything anyway, because everything he did, there's really no evidence for guys, so we need to remember that. We should also take this moment and say even if someone did do something similar, even if someone did do something similar, without a justification, like he would have if he had done it. No one deserves to be killed by the state. That is an unjust wrong thing, and it's fucking insane that we still do it.",

Here are the most recent election results that's not done yet. Here's the Conservative Party, not quite as Conservatives Republicans, and here's AFD, far-right fascists. And I really want you to hear me when I say that. They have been legally by the court of Germany been categorized as fascists. Multiple of their sub-parties, the parties within different regions, have been labeled as domestic terrorist organizations. And now they are getting 20% of the German electorate vote. There is a rise of far-right populism, fascism, in the West right now. That's just unequivocal. But there's also a rise of something else. This is D-Linka. The far left-wing organization in Germany, and it got 8.7% of the votes, which means it has enough votes to have seats in the Bundestag. As fascist gain power, the best thing to fight them also does. Commies. And D-Linka has connections to the former Communist Party. And AFD has connections to the Nazi Party. We've seen this fight before. Nazis know how to fight, Nazis know how to kill, but they don't know how to rule. Commies will win. The question we have is how long we give the Nazis to do evil shit. So, German election? Not looking great. Not great to see the rise of the fascists. But at least the Germans know how to respond. Actually give leftist power. And us in America need to learn from that. Liberals are uncapable of responding to fascism. Leftists historically have been the only way to beat them.",

Because that gets eyes on the issue and then I can use that to talk about radical politics. And in reality, the vast majority of people that see any of my content see one piece of content from me. And if I can use that to connect a hot person that they like kind of and have seen a lot more to, to good, effective, mobilizing politics, bam, fantastic. And that involves me, you know, thirsting a little bit, being a bit like them, talking about things that they feel and are, and then also connecting it to actually well-reasoned and well-constructed politics. So I agree. I go a little bit hard on ha ha ha like Luigi's hot. But number one, it gets views, it gets clicks, it gets eyes on it. And then we can divert that attention that the media wants to divert into other bullshit-ass politics about whether trans people should be in bathrooms who fucking cares into like mobilizing and doing important shit.",

    "text": "The Luigi moment is not hot guy does thing we like it. I mean, he is hot and he probably didn't do the thing according to me. The moment is saying, it's kind of cool to stand up to the ruling class that are very flagrantly committing violence against us. And I want to connect that to some other discussions that we've been having online, which is first of all like mutual aid and community building in times like these where the ruling class and really the DOJ at this point, you see what happened in Comrade Workwear, he is beating down any support, you need a community to rely on, to call when the cops are coming, to bail you out, to hide you if you also do a cool thing. All of that is community building in mutual aid. You're building the infrastructure to exist and be effective in resisting and surviving under fascism. And I've talked about this before, but also the difference between identity politics and identity essentialism. This guy was a white, upper class, rich guy. But that positionality allowed him to do the thing he allegedly did. Finally, this is what scared the elites. The public response was not to be a tool of the elites. They didn't come out condemning him for committing violence allegedly. They came out and said, yeah, we don't really care. That's fucking cool. That's permission. That's the public saying, we're not gonna help oppress you. If you're gonna fight back against your oppression, you're actually gonna get a lot of our support. And that's so important. Because for better or for worse, the ruling class does need the working class to do its oppression, both culturally to keep us down and materially to steal our labor. And so if we're at the point where the working class will not do the oppression, will not beat down the resistance themselves, that's fucking scary to the ruling class. This probably is just a moment in time, even though martyrs live forever in our mind, if they do choose to do the death penalty, God forbid. But that's not cynical, right? We use moments in time to build the infrastructure and the movement for resistance. And that's what we should be doing. Connecting these discussions that we've been having, right? Into actually what that looks like. And this is a great case study for it.",

But in his first term, we got a saw him surrounded by people like Jared Kushner, who was really effective at getting truly atrocious foreign deals done. And so when I'm talking about Trump's doing this and doing it for this reason, what I'm really saying is the actions of the Trump administration, whomever is informing them, right, whether it's Trump's emotional idiotic cell for the oligarchs behind and where the advisors he has, are doing it for this reason because it benefits this unified goal between them. And there can be disfrant interests across those groups, but that's part of the analysis. So, starting our analysis as Trump's stupid, he's not going to get anything done. Number one isn't true. He's actually being very, very effective at being an authoritarian fascist. But second of all, isn't helpful to understand why and how he is doing what he's doing.

And it is irresponsible, both in the media and privately, because I've been the MD about it like ten times, to put more focus on the death and brutality against Israeli children than the onslaught and slaughter of Palestinian children. It is brutal and it is racist. I have empathy for everyone harmed, especially children, but I despise you if your empathy only extends to this family.",

    "text": "Trump is a fascist, but what does that actually mean? Understand that, you first need to understand what nationalism is. Because fascism can be described in two very effective ways. It is a form of ultra-nationalism, and then Mussolini also described it as more aptly called corporatism. And those two ideas, if understood, best understand fascism. So let's start with nationalism. Nationalism is not merely liking where you grew up, right? I grew up in North Carolina. I like the mountains. That doesn't make a me on North Carolina's. Nationalism is the belief that like the nation should be the primary political unit. It is a necessary belief that the nation is more deserving of its state than other nations or peoples. People suggest that nationalism can be divorced from national supremacy. I disagree. Necessary in nationalism, the idea that the nation, a certain group of people with a certain group of culture, language, etc. ideas, you have to believe they're better than other people to care about them more. Otherwise, it doesn't logically follow. So ultra-nationalism takes that to its logical conclusion, which is that those people of this appear your nation should take over people of inferior nations, or are more deserving of territory than people of inferior nations. But beyond the supremacy element, there's also the identity element, which is that before you are a worker, before you are a Christian, before you are gay, before you are a man, you are an American. It is the subsuming of all your identities into the nation. And importantly, what the fuck does being an American mean? It means really whatever the person speaking wants it to mean. What does being a German mean? What does being an Italian, a Frenchman, a spaniard mean? Not much, right? You can really shape them to whatever end you want. And even if we agree what they mean, what does that mean for foreign policy or domestic policy? Also really unclear. What fascism does is it takes a national identity, a national myth, right? The Germans are descended of the Roman Empire, or the Americans are descended of some great Europeans with great ideas, and forms it into a cohesive political idea, and then galvanizes people behind it. That is what fascism does, and that is by definition what Trump has tried to do. But second of all, it's core partism, which is it sells this idea of a nation, of an American, of a German, of Italian, right? Galvanizes the working class. But then it has the benefits of the capitalist class. It has the groupings of saying instead of unionizing as workers, you actually have more in common with the capitalist than you do with the spaniards. So stop fighting them. Why are you fighting them? Let's work together. Let's make the nation better. Actually, these corporatists, because they built so much for the nation, because they're bringing in so much money for the nation, they're actually heroes. It's a combination of the nation and the corporation. Fascism, the factions in fascism are the different factions representing the nation, working together in the government being constantly rebody of those factions. And I've gotten about 10 million questions about what fascism is, and I'm actually not using fascism, right? I am. Trump is precisely trying to do that. He's ruled by all the arcs, those corporations, and he's trying to say that you have to subsume your identity under was American. He's going after non-Christian bias. What the fuck does that mean? He's going after anything labeled un-American, un-national. He showed up to the Super Bowl. No president has done that yet. That's clearly an appeal to a national identity. And so yes, it starts small, but we don't attack bad ideas just when they're at their natural conclusion. We attack them from the infancy to prevent them from getting here.",

    "text": "Nationalism is bad and it's a tool of fascists. Let's break that down. Here's the definition, right? It's identification with one's own nations and support for its interests, especially at the exclusion or detriment of the interests of other nations. This is not superfluous. This is necessary. Let's respond to the first thing I always hear when I'm talking about nationalism, which is that, oh, I love the place I grew up. There's nothing wrong with that. I agree. I grew up in Charlotte. I love the buildings. I love some of the fields. You know, it's a cool place, but that doesn't mean I have something more in common with people from Alaska or Hawaii than I do with people from British Columbia, right? That's the nonsense that nationalism leads to. I can love North Carolina without loving Alaska more than I love Canada. You know what I mean? If you actually sit and break these things down, it is just a set of social rules. It's a legal construction in the nation. And the reason it's dangerous isn't just because it's arbitrary, right? The reason it's dangerous is that arbitrariness allows people, especially without intentions, to fill in those gaps. What does it mean to be an American? I don't fucking know. I mean, a lot of people identify Americans with the slaveholders and the slaves, right? The people, the colonizers and the colonized. Both the founding fathers and the emancipators. How do we do that? It's contradictory in its nonsense. But that nonsense allows especially rising fascists to go, I'm America. And if you don't believe in me, you don't believe in America. You're not Christian, you're not American. Even though you can't really argue with that, right? Because it is an empty concept. And this is back through time. Nationalism, as we now know, it started with Napoleon, right, where he was trying to end the revolution. And how he did that was by saying, guys, we need to stop killing Frenchmen because the French are better than everyone. Let's go kill everyone else and that's Napoleonic Wars. The British did the same. They nation built as opposed to the French because they said, guys, we're better than the French. We should go beat them in Africa, beat them in America, beat them in Asia, right? Colonialism. And famously, German nationalism led to saying, you know who's not German? Jewish people, the Roma people, the Serbs. That's not an accident. That's a natural conclusion to drawing circles around people and giving them state power on being in or outside of that circle, which is exactly what nationalism does. And in my view, there's really no middle ground here. Either you're a nationalist and you accept the nation as the core political unit, right? And you accept these arbitrary boundaries. You accept the boundaries drawn by the capitalist and the fascists or your anti-nationalist. And you reject these boundaries and you think that humans have more in common with each other than Americans do. And that's the ideology I take. And you can draw your circles in different ways, right? You can draw it around the nation, you can draw it around the state, you can draw it around ethnicity, a people, a religion, a tribe. I choose to draw it around every human, right? But ultimately, if you accept politicians and statesmen determining where you draw that circle, you are giving them a lot of power. And that power is just right to be misused.",

That's so interesting because he most certainly does. He nominated the Supreme Court justices that overruled the constitutional protections on abortion. His executive agencies have unilateral discretion on allowing abortion on federal lands, which constitute 30% of lands in the United States. They could make abortion clinics on that, or they could outlaw it there. That's their choice. This is just not true. He has jurisdiction in DC, he has jurisdiction in federal lands, and also he nominated the people that changed the constitutional interpretation. Who's in charge the president does not have the power to take away anyone's rights? But if that right goes to the individual states and whether or not the people vote on it. So Trump doesn't eat women? First of all, no, it's a constitutional right, it should be protected constitutionally and federally. Second of all, yeah, of course he hates women, he assaulted them.",

We know that Jill Stein basically won no relevant votes, and when it afflicts like a single district, and we know that Gaza was a major issue for those that chose not to vote for Kamala.

    "text": "Don't be like an emperor that doesn't realize how empires work. And that's because he's a fascist, and a fascist are famously the dying throws of an empire. I get a lot of flak for using that word, but I want to go back in history, because historically, fascist have risen either when an empire is dead or dying, or when people failed an empire. Italy fucking failed an empire. Germany empire died. The Spanish fascism rose when the Spanish empire receded. Same thing with the Portuguese empire. History doesn't repeat, but it does rhyme. And the American empire is coming to a close and Trump knows this. That's why he's moving a little bit away from Israel, and he's moving towards America gaining integral rather than vassal territories. Right? America's used to having all of Europe as a vassal state. They're used to having Israel as a vassal state, but America now is making moves to take Gaza's integral territory, control of the Panama Canal, and with Gaza the Suez. Greenland would be integral territory and he wants Canada. He wants to extend the American nation, not the American empire, which is what makes sense when you are in a multipolar world. You can't have an expansive empire, but you can have a strong nation. The issue with that though is that whenever they have tried to do this, this necessarily involves a massive increase in nationalism, and as you take places that are not of that nation, a either cultural genocide of the people that live there, or a physical genocide of them. You either deny them their culture and their nation, or you get rid of them. America did this as they were nation building. Right? As they were nation building through the west of America, we genocide to the natives. And that was because America had a certain concept of itself, and natives were not allowed within that concept, as well as the economic interests of denying them their own territory. We did it in the Philippines, and we ultimately lost. That's why we got rid of the Philippines. We were not successful in culturally genociding the Filipinos. And so while the end of the American empire has its benefits, the reclusion of America into itself is generally good for other people. It is extraordinarily dangerous and leads to some of the worst atrocities known to man, as it does expand its actual nation. That's fucking scary.",

The right ideology is the ideology for oven by the elite ruling class. The issue is that in America, our left has been liberals. Who are capitalists? That's the ideology of the ruling elite. It's just that our working class has been tricked into believing it. And that's not because they're like dumb, right? That's because the ruling class is super fucking powerful. And they're propaganda works, and they create really compelling ideas. That fuck us over. So yes, I love this. Upverse down not left first right. Fantastic class consciousness.

It's what's left over of this like white Protestant perfectionist work ethic Where if someone doesn't exactly align with everything you believe they're going to hell and it actually isn't worth dealing with them as a human and that's not Leftist right but leftists as humans still have to work through that and still exhibit and apply that to some of their actions and That often disillusions people because they see that in leftism and think we're no better Which sometimes is true, but on an ideological basis you actually work against that and the only way you deconstruct these Carceral mindsets these harmful mindsets is by going further and further into actually good values and discussions So don't just be disillusioned with leftists because they're like humans and horrible as well because everyone sucks But do try and reference what types of these ideologies what parts of these ideologies are left over from Carceral Protestant evangelical mindsets and which of them are really revolutionary and productive And then you'll get a lot less disillusioned with just people being people",

Every popular uprising has had their martyrs, their revolutionaries, their myths to tell about the revolution. That's how you motivate and mobilize the masses. It's not because of the individual act. It's because the story and the communication that that individual act has. And Luigi did a very similar thing. It wasn't the act that he did. Killing a CEO actually does very little, right? Because you're going to replace the CEO. What scared the upper class was how willing and loving everyone was to him. How much we did it, revile in his upset against the liberal order of good and evil and violence and nonviolence. But rather we recognized that this was an inevitability of a system that was killing us. We recognized the violence in the system and responded. That's what has the effect. And if you're going to shame people for allowing their actions to be the communication of that, we're certainly going to get anything done.",

And this is exactly the thing we should be learning from fascists, which is that the neoliberal order that insists that non-violence is only the way and violence will always just make it worse is failing. And the rate has realized this, that's where they're going to fascism. Fascism is the rejection of that idea and the embracing of authoritarian violence to get what you want, the language of power, the power of the oligarchs. And liberalism is entirely neutered to respond to that. Liberalism is only an ideology that works within an existing system that has the power. Leftism, the language of the power of the workers, is what works. Because what scared people about Luigi was not like one guy having a gun. It was the whole entire working class coming out and not doing the job of the oligarchs. Not being angry at him, not hating him, not ostracizing, but actually embracing and engaging with the action that he allegedly did. Once again, never been proven, guys. That's the danger. And so if we start speaking the language of power as workers, the oligarchs are going to fucking piss themselves.",

That's not unique of other expansionist empires, the Germans famously were genocidal when they were expansionist, so were the Brits. And famously, the Portuguese did as well. But it's important that these are not silly little suggestions. Taking over Greenland would necessitate either a cultural genocide of the natives or a physical genocide of the natives. Taking over Gaza self-admittedly necessitates the killing or ethnic cleansing of the people in that territory.

It doesn't really matter that you think you're ideologically justified. You are. If you are a leftist and you're laughing at liberals, because now these horrendous policies are happening. Or you're a liberal laughing at leftists because Gaza has gotten worse. Nothing about a genocide should cause you joy. Asshole. I just wanted to clarify because that's going to be my metric going forward. And then we'll work from there. But don't be an asshole and we'll be fine.",

It is the primary, if not single, reason that a lot of South America are in right-wing dictatorships and not left-wing democracies or dictatorships. This is the reason in the Middle East Bathism, a socialist ideology, where it did succeed became authoritarian and dictatorial and right-wing, and it failed wherever it could be democratic or international. And it's like this weird breed of right-wing populist that has learned that the CIA is evil, but not put together that it's because of their own ideology that it is evil? Like, yes, come, Rad, come join us, you know, fight against the expansionist empire of America through its clandestine operations of the CIA. But like, for two seconds have some self-reflection and consider why it is so fucking evil and under what ideology it's leading to be evil.",

Getting rid of the Department of Education will only give states less options and less of an ability to provide a quality education to every American. That is because education constitutionally is a state right. It is only within the state's purview. The purpose the Department of Education is to supplement and provide extra resources and options and harmonization across the United States. That is why they deal with things like pell grounds and the FAFSA that you failed out to get college money. That is not limiting your options of education. That is massively expanding them. They also deal with disability aid so that disabled children of all states have an equal right no matter how wealthy that state is. They also do write curriculum so that states that could otherwise not afford curriculum or that are interrelated so that states that are close by will have similar curriculum. It is allowing them to do more with their education much much much much much much less than it's restricting the states what they can do. And actually it can't restrict a state. It's not within its power. So please for the love of God don't allow the Republicans to tell you that it's useless. They are praying on the fact that you don't know what the Department of Education does to abolish a vital lifeline for the most marginalized students.",

No, but we did imagine that they would care about their grocery prices over their grocery prices. Because Trump's proposed tariffs would immediately and directly increase their cost of living. Whereas the Democrats options of providing $8,000 to new parents would immediately satiate that. I actually think that putting people's identity as the frontrunner of their campaign. Did they really think that just everyday Americans who are going to work, they're not chronically online like all of us? Did you actually think they were going to say, you know what, I'm going to go to the ballot box and vote for them. Are we watching the same Democratic campaign? The one where Kamala refused to answer if she supported transgender affirming care? The one that was primarily focused on Kamala being anti-immigration, that was primarily focused on providing funds to new homeowners? Did we see the same thing? Because it was Trump that put social issues at the front. He was the one that made trans issues an issue. He was the one that questioned gay marriage. He was the one that came after immigrants. I mean, where's the disconnect? Because the person who can't afford to eat is not giving a flying about whether or not your kid can be put on blockers. Have you spoken to a Trump voter? Have you actually, like, really? Because they do. I mean, a lot of them voted on social war issues. That's why the right wing won't stop talking about it. Like, if you turn on Fox News for two seconds, they're not going to be talking about economic policies. By and large, they're talking about social war issues. Trump also, like, blames everything on DEI. That's a social issue. That's making the working class care about social issues. What are you talking about? Like, this is what I mean when there's just a disconnective reality. The Democrats actually did abandon a lot of their social values and social principles. Once again, Kamala refused to say if she supported trans affirming care for children. She just didn't say it. And yet it was a Trump that came after DEI, villainized migrants. That's a social policy, right? It's xenophobia. So if you're saying that we should stop focusing on social policies, you're actually going to find a lot of agreement with me. But that is not the left. The left didn't run on social policies. Y'all did.",

And I'm not saying that's what's going to happen, but I just think it's information that's relevant, so stick with me. After the American invasion of Iraq, we didn't just change regime. We took out the whole government, meaning the police people, no job, teachers, no job, bureaucrats, judges, gone, totally to be replaced. And then that is a huge portion of what eventually became al-Qaeda in Iraq. And I say this because Trump is going to fire a lot of CIA agents, a lot of state department agents, and then a lot of seemingly innocuous bureaucrats. But they will have no other abilities other than government abilities, and when those government abilities are not working for the government, naturally, they would be working against it. So I think what he's doing is very dangerous, not only to us, but to himself.",

This is from the Israeli government, sure that they would know their enemies better than that. And the demonization of Israel. It is physical. This is how they put those three words together. Anti-Semitism and deligitimization. It's because they want you to think that deligitimization of Israel is anti-Semitism. It's not. The Palestinian Union law is illustrated by throwing stone to the idea of social. This is just a flagrant lie, not happened, never happened. The police are just terrorists parachuting into the cubits to massacres civilians on October 7th. During recess, he and his friends were school shirts with a slogan of AXA flood. Okay, so I just want to remind you all, the Palestinian Authority has condemned Hamas's AXA flood. They've condemned October 7th. So this is saying, just hear me out, that Palestinian Authority, which has not only condemned Hamas, but also actively fought against, like physically fought against Hamas, are training their people to be coming Hamas. So they're training their people to be the people that they are on at fighting. That's some America shit right there. This is just made up. And also, what the fuck curriculum has updated in this past year to include art of October 7th. It's been one year, guys, and the PA, once again, has been under consistent assault. They don't have time to update their curriculum. What are we on? It is a terror factory. Okay, so it's quite obvious that they just made a bunch of shit up. Some of this are things that Israel has presented in unru schools. But I want to remind you, unra is different than the Palestinian Authority. The Palestinian Authority controls what's in their curriculum in the PA in the West Bank. What they're talking about is stuffing Gaza. Two different places, two different regimes. That kind of matters when you're trying to suggest one organization which is fighting terrorists are creating terrorists. And that's not a mistake. They're doing that on purpose, right? If you don't know the difference, you would think they're all the same, right? It's a they all look the same to me, principle. Israel doesn't like the PA just as much as they don't like a mosque, quite honestly. But second of all, I wanted the whole framing of this is very racist. To describe the education system as like a factory putting together machines is contributing to a racial stereotype and archetype of Arabs as merely animalistic machines. It's racist, it's xenophobic, it's not fucking helpful. Not only is it a flagrant lie, but it's also a bigoted lie.",

    "text": "Let's watch Israeli propaganda part 10. If you're looking at the claim of genocide, it would assume that the population of the people who are the targets of the genocide has decreased. No it wouldn't. Here's the definition of genocide according to the genocide convention to which Israel's a signatory and four of the five ways that you can commit genocide don't actually necessarily reduce the population. You can cause serious bodily or mental harm to the members of the group. You can deliberately lower the life conditions to bring a physical destruction to an inholder in part. You can impose measures to prevent births or you can forcefully transfer children from one group to another. Those things don't necessarily destroy the population. And actually this is not true of all genocides. For example, the amount of Bosnian acts in the world has increased for the past 30 years. But they were genocide by Serbia. The amount of Armenians also has increased. Doesn't stop what Azerbaijan did to them from being a genocide. I want to stress this is basically the only point she makes here. She just goes on and on about how the Palestinian population has gone down. That's not a requirement for genocide. You're just lying. If there were truly a genocide against the Palestinian people from the outset when the Palestinians became a people or have I started identifying as a people. That's an interesting place to start. Right? Because if you use that logic with other genocides just to be clear, when you hear a government defunding education, defunding diplomacy and putting more funding into the military, what governments do you think of? If you're being honest with yourself, I don't think you think of modern liberal democracies. You think of the type of fascist states that we fought super hard to get rid of. And yet those are exactly the policies that Donald Trump is promoting and those are exactly the policies that right wing grifters are just hopping on ship to support. And I want to remind you, it is nothing but following what Trump is doing because no consistent interest group or ideology supports what he's doing. Libertarians should be for immigration. If you're a nationalist, you should be for diplomacy like USAID. If you're an actual conservative, right, you would not want to destroy the institutions of the United States. If you only consistent group that Trump is helping and benefiting are the oligarchs, everyone else is just riding the wave.",

This obviously it's an offense against the rule of law and fundamental liberal institutions in America, but it's also just stupid. If it just tries to tell a general how to conduct a military operation, that would be illegal. No, it wouldn't. We actually have whole branches of the judiciary to regulate the military and adjudicate on how the military do their operations. That tries to command the AG in how to use her discretion as a prosecutor. That's also illegal. No, it's not. Judges do it all the time. Actually, that's the whole purpose of judges. They have, so the AG has a certain amount of discretion, meaning they have a choice over which great cases to go after, which people to go after. And then a judge gets to determine, number one, if they're using that discretion unfairly, like if it violates the civil rights act, for example. And number two, to what extent that just discretion has effect. So if they want to go after a case, does the judge accept it? It's not allowed to control the executives, legitimate power. No, no, no, that's precisely what the judges do. That's what separations of power is. Congress controls the executive and the executive controls Congress and Congress controls the judge. Like, there's a big relationship here. Yes, judges can tell the executive what to do. They regulate them. They tell them what the laws say. If you don't want those laws to regulate you, go to Congress and ask them to change it. Don't become a fucking dictator.",

    "text": "Fifth Trump attempting to fire the CIA. The question is, how is he going to maintain power? Because this comment is correct. In order to maintain power, you need to keep a certain amount of the keys of power happy, whether that's the capital owners, the people, the military, right, or the secret police, like the CIA. And I think it's an important note that what Trump is doing is he is reshuffling the keys of power in America. Previously in America, we had a healthy dose of oligarchy and business interest, a some amount of keeping the people appeased and happy, right, and then a quite large amount of institutional built-in power, whether that's the secret police or the institutional politicians. What Trump's doing is he's basically kicking out the institutional politicians and making it an even mix between about 20 or 30% of the population that are far, far right wing fanatics, right, and then his new secret police, where there's a strong overlap here, and then his oligarchs, those are the keys of power. And the governments that have that type of keys of power are fissistic governments, those are how they keep power. They keep the businesses and oligarchs in power, and then they keep the dissuaded working class that has lost their fucking mind happy by going after minorities. And that means that you can keep that 20 or 30% happy by just picking off that one or two percent minorities every few years. And then you keep the oligarchs happy by getting rid of, for example, the EPA, which he's doing.",

Among other things. Donald Trump isn't interested in the real critiques of the CIA, which is that it maintains the American Empire. He is interested in the CIA's threat to his power. That is, it's power to protect the institutions of the American government. And while we don't think those institutions need much protecting, I.e. the institutions of Empire, they certainly should be protecting against a fascist. And so he is trying to destroy them. And so all this is like a whiplash of 10 million things he's doing.

It matters that you know, and if it didn't, they wouldn't lie to you about it. And I can prove they're lying about it. Trump will habitually say that he's just getting rid of it so that curriculum can be written on a state level again because they know how to teach their children better. What he'll fail to mention is that states already are the only ones with rights to write curriculum. That's why your state history was in your state's curriculum, guys. A huge portion of the value of a federal Department of Education is that poorer states, which don't have as many property taxes, get subsidies from the federal government so that those children have an equal right to education. They have more choice in having education. Also, a huge function of the federal government is to ensure that disabled children have an equal chance at education and subsidizing disability accommodations. If you don't believe number one, poor kids deserve the right to an education just as much as rich kids, rich kids, and number two that disabled kids deserve it just as much as everyone else, I don't know what we're doing here, but you won't hear that. And I'm not blaming you for that. No one knows what every single organization in the federal government's primary purpose is, right? Y'all don't work there. And Trump is requiring that. He's betting that you don't know the good thing so that he can lie to you about what good and evil they do. So as Trump ram pages through a federal government, remember a lot of these were hard-fought gains that we should protect tooth and nail.",

These types of stories, these types of mythos, the cultures that surround resistance and oppression, that we have the opportunity to build as a generation, have an opportunity to inform and mobilize people to do fantastic things. And that type of culture around protecting the oppressed, being the resistance, never giving into fascism, is the only culture that can effectively and consistently rebuke and prevent fascism from rising and continuing to rise. I know it's abstract, but it doesn't know the way it's very concrete. We need to think about the stories, cultures, and martyrs that will promote resistance that we need.",

But second of all, you cut out the part of the video where I actually made the point, which is it matters what they're attempting to represent by burning that flag. People if they burn the Mexican flag in America, typically it's because they're anti-immigrants. That's bigotry and racist. But if a Mexican burns a Mexican flag, right, typically they're protesting the Mexican government. That's all good, guys. Similar things with Israel. If people are burning it because they fucking hate Jewish people, yeah, that's bigotent racist. But at NYU, for example, when Jewish people are burning the Israeli flag or people that are protesting the Israeli government of burning the flag, it's because they're protesting a government and a state and an actions of states. That's not bigotry and racism, which I made clear in the video, which you cut out because you're lying about what I said. You can't actually defend the things I actually said. Flag. It's not because you hate Jewish people. You're right, you're not against the Jewish people. If you burn the Israeli flag in my bag, you're just against 97% of the Jewish people that support the state of Israel. So you're not. So first of all, at NYU, it was a Jewish person burning the flag. So it makes this argument really difficult. But second of all, most Zionists, most supporters of Israel, not Jewish, most of them are Christian, most of them are white. Am I against Christians or white people because I'm against Israel and Zionism? No, no, I'm not. That's not how bigotry works, my guy. Goes on to condescend to me on the basis of my age and call me a white savior, which like whatever, at least I'm not supporting a genocide.",

This is going to be a long battle. You can't do it right now. So do as much as you can. Find community, find protest, find ways to slow down the cogs of fascism. Call up your reps, call up anyone with any power to stop it. If you know people in the military, call them and tell them to not follow criminal orders. If you know people in the government, tell them to not follow criminal orders. If you're in the government, don't follow criminal orders. But if you need to take a second and fall on that community, that we keep advocating to build, do that. So you can fight next week and the week after.",

You know who else massively advocated autarky and was a right-wing person? The Emperor of Japan. Autarky was actually a massive justification for Liebensraum, Germany. It is a consistent trope of fascists that they move from being an empire, which America has been for the past 50 years, to an autarkic, ethno-nationalist state. Trump is falling perfectly in line with that pattern. And I think it's very interesting because I don't like imperialism, but I really don't like ethno-nationalist states, because that is what leads to genocide on the largest scale. And we are seeing that happen. When he is demonizing illegal immigrants, do you think he's only demonizing illegal immigrants? Do you think that concentration camp in Gitmo is going to be just illegal immigrants really? Do you think only illegal immigrants are going to get sent out Salvador? No. All of these policies are not only reminiscent, but immediately pulled from the fascist playbook.",

And it's almost laughable because he claims to be this huge America first guy, but things like USAID are explicitly made to boost American foreign power. It's undoubtable that they also help people, but they do maintain control of America's soft and hard power throughout the world. And that's what's so weird about Trump's foreign policy. He seems to merely remember that America likes Israel, but he forgets that America funds also about 100 other terrorist groups in the world, because it helps our power. And I guess the takeaway I would get from this is, as we're seeing Trump do stupid fucking foreign policy and advocate radical changes of foreign policy, I want to remind you, America is only able to do insanely wild foreign policy because we are the hegemon, because we are the imperial power of the world. But Trump is degrading that power, and we will, or I hope we will, see our allies and our proxies go against us, or at least not support us.",

And don't mince words on this, he's not trying to relocate, he's not trying to rebuild, he's ethnically cleansing. That is both a domestic crime and an international crime. Donald Trump just admitted to being a war criminal. And so, well, ultimately he does have the huge force of the US military behind him to do this in evil act. I want to remind everyone who is either in the military or knows someone who's in the military. If you are given an order to do something that is illegal or has the chance to be illegal, you have the right to question that order at least within military court. We all, universally, have a moral obligation to stop ethnic cleansing in every single way we can. Don't allow them to do it again.",

Give hundreds of thousands of vaccines every year. And so instead, Trump gets to tell you they did a transgender play and then just move on.

North Carolina, my home state, had one of the largest scale ones where we sterilized thousands of black people and gay people and disabled people. Not only did we have a fascist party, but the United Kingdom also had a fascist party. The Nazis, wall uniquely horrendous, were not unique in their ideology.

There's nothing new about these things in American history, and it's actually deeply built into many people's American identities. If you go ask a lot of people, most of America identifies with Ireland. Irish people fought violently for their independence and they had to look after each other while they did that. And so as we go into a period where we will need our communities, we will need to watch out for each other, we will need strong cultural ties to each other. Remember that we aren't building this from scratch? We've done this before. People have done this before. And these aren't dirty words, these aren't dirty online leftist words.

So there's no doubt in my mind that a lot of Trump's policies are to allow a crash in the economy, which is what will happen if you stop funding Pell grants, if you stop funding any grants to anyone, so that his cronies can buy up all the capital and rent it back to you. It's not confusing, it's not arbitrary, it's not irrational, it's planned, and he gets to be irrational, because being crazy crashes the economy.",

No, American laws generally are not enforceable against diplomats even on American soil. This isn't controversial, complicated, or questioned law, Cam. Everyone agrees on this generally. No, diplomats, and I mean, the famous cases like diplomats' children in America, if they do like a speeding ticket, they don't get prosecuted. The worst we can do is expel them. There are some minor exceptions to this, that is to say when they're acting outside of their diplomatic mission. But if we go to, for example, other heads of state, they have what is damn near close to absolute immunity. That is to say, American laws don't have jurisdiction over them. This isn't an argument. You don't know the law. Why do you pretend you know the law? Also, I'm not arguing that the law should be this way or that way.

Here's how it reads, all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. Trump and his cronies realize that most people don't know what the AND subject to jurisdiction thereof means or is therefore. Let's just be very clear this is settled national and international law. The subject to the jurisdiction thereof is to exclude diplomats children. That's the purpose, so that if you're like a cotari diplomat and you have a child in America, they aren't forced to have American citizenship. And it's laughable because jurisdiction is just merely the fact that law applies to this person. And if we didn't believe that law applied to immigrants, why would he call them criminals?",

We got tariffs on like everything including Taiwan, along with a bunch of other culture war issues. Yes, Trump is racist. Yes, Trump is xenophobic.

The only thing that people that come out and say, I told you so, or, of course, these races do is go against the revolution. It's counter-revolutionary. And I'm guilty of this as well because, personally, it's fucking frustrating, right? To be screaming at liberals for four years that they're going to do fascist shit. And then now liberals are saying there's the solution to their evil fascist shit? That's frustrating, right? But we need to process that frustration and respond in an actually helpful productive manner, which is not to be mad at the people that are genuinely horrified right now.

But the way you solve this is really clear if you look at the history of leftist revolutionaries, you find other emotions to harness, joy, community, security. These are things baked into the leftist ideology that are rife to be used, and the right uses them and liberals use them. There is no reason leftist shouldn't use them. And yet, sometimes there is a superiority complex that happens in leftist spaces on who can be the angriest, who can be the saddest. That is counter-revolutionary. And if our spaces are nothing but angry and sad, no one will join us, obviously. And it's also useless. Liberation should be joyous.",

No two ways around it. Even America stopped doing it because the fascists started copying them. And people don't know that. But more importantly, people will think that it had some meaning in the Roman Empire. It didn't. There's no evidence that a salute of that kind was used to bitchually in Rome. That is believed as a myth. It is not true. It is a misunderstanding of Roman art. And it was a misunderstanding of Roman art that was used by the Nazis and by the Italian fascists to propagate their nationalism. This is not a debate.

There is room for a discussion about how leftists engage with electorosum, but we must not lose sight of the reason fascist gain power in America, which is the same reason they have historically in other countries, which is the complete and other failure of liberal politics in capitalism to address the real needs of the working class.

So the second I found out that I could go to the West Bank, I was like, where the fuck is CNN? Where the fuck is MSN? Where are these people? Because they know the story of it will find. That's interesting because they published the story they found. I mean, they literally went into the West Bank with the reporter and published what that reporter said. So you're just lying. Like this isn't propaganda. It's just a lie. Yes, reporters can go into the West Bank. They get killed by Israel, but they can go. Everyone knows this. You know how we know this? Because we've seen it in the news. You're just lying. Like there's no spin here. There's no complexity. Give me something harder, Missod. You're just lying. Anyway, he goes on to be like, well, anyone can go into the West Bank. Americans can go into West Bank. Yeah, that's the problem. That Israel controls the borders. When they shouldn't, it should be the Palestinians that just determine who go into their country. Crazy. So I guess this is kind of a boring episode because it's just a liar. I mean, you're just a liar. But I do want to note that they will say this and say mainstream isn't covering what's being said. And then we'll ignore the huge amount of human rights reports that have been written about how horrible the conditions are for Palestinians and the West Bank.

In order for an amendment to be ratified, it must be ratified by three fits of the states. Three fits of the states have ratified it, but certain states put a sunset clause on their ratification, meaning if it did not reach three fifths within seven years for some of the states, they withdrew their ratification. And so now that there have been three fifths of the states that have ratified it, the question is whether their sunset clauses are valid. This has not been litigated upon by the Supreme Court yet. It is an open constitutional question. My personal view is that this Supreme Court should take this up and say, fuck yes, the Equal Rights Amendment is good American law and the 28th American Amendment to the Constitution. But they haven't done that because of their dips. But what Biden has done is he has just said via executive order that in fact, it is American good law. It's questionable whether that's in his jurisdiction, but what the fuck is it in the President's jurisdiction at this point? You know?",

And then it was given back to us to benefit the narcissist and all like arch-Donald Trump. And then it still has a 90-day waiting period where things feel weird. All of that is calculated to maintain control. The way the CIA or oppressive regimes maintain control is through eternal war. It is never peacetime. It is never normal. It is never every day. You are always giving up your freedoms and giving up normalcy to fight the enemy or to have a change. And abusers do the same thing. They push you, push you, push you, get as much as they can out of pushing you. And then they make you beg and plead and be subservient to them just for a sense of normalcy. Just to get TikTok back for 90 days. We have to beg and plead Donald Trump. And I want to point this out so we start recognizing this. There are certain actions that people that want to maintain power at all costs, personally, politically, diplomatically or militarily, do. And they're almost always consistent.

It doesn't even have to knock out a server, they just need to buy a controlling portion. Or already have it. Elon Musk uses his controlling chair of Twitter to censor extreme ideals. And any ideals that critique him. That is a problem, no matter who you are. So there are technological solutions that already exist. I was radicalized by torrenting. Torrenting is a amazing thing. And we have the technology that exists. It just needs to be used in this way. So while you can find your favorite creators who are on blue sky, using the massacred on whatever to decentralize and diversify the social media's that they would have to go down to shut down those ideas. And second of all, I hope following the TikTok band people learn that is important to build secure, controlled and owned networks by the people from the people rather than from the oligarchs for the oligarchs.",

But this does give us more time to organize when we see the real threat ahead of us, which is all of our social media either being owned by the oligarch control state, or the oligarchs themselves.

I've spent the last five years now talking about leftism, political ideologies, and debating the dumbest people on the internet. And I've seen the type of community building that can happen on TikTok. I've seen the type of community building that it can bring out building discord servers, building understanding, building growth and learning. So obviously I'm distressed by the TikTok ban. But what I do have to say is do not allow this to be a community killing event, allow it to be a community building event. And what I mean by that is red note won't be the solution. Blue sky won't be the solution. Instagram won't be the solution. Right. The solution. And the only thing that will work is a confederated internet where you have genuine control over your audience. Because especially as a person that has been talking about pastime this past year, I have seen that even TikTok has limits to how much you own your audience. And if we don't own all-round audience, if we don't own the media that we consume and produce, who does? It'll be the oligarchs that take over America the second day on our media. So this goes back to why I got radicalized in the first place. I got radicalized by torrenting completely legal open source books. But in torrenting, if you don't know what it is, it's downloading from a huge network of people across the internet. And it's an amazing community building experience if you really think about it. And we have that opportunity to do with our social media. We can own our media. It is possible. We have the technology right now to do it. And people are working on it. So if you've seen the people working on the app protocol TikTok version, do it. Support them. Follow them. Download it. Because that is basically blue sky with TikTok features. And the beautiful thing about blue sky is that if you take down the blue sky central server, I want you to think about this in physical terms, you can copy and paste your data to another server and maintain the social network. Okay. Blue sky, the server will have issues. It will be owned. But you can take it. And so they can't take away your audience. They can't take away your media if you own it. And that should always be the goal, the standard, the point, the push we have. And so follow me on blue sky if you don't already. I'm going to be moving all my stuff onto it. I'm going to be downloading all of this and moving my media over there just so we're clear. But find your other creators. DM them. Tell them to get on this. If they don't want to get on blue sky, get on mastodon. Get on something decentralized. Make this what we own. And don't allow meta to own our data. Don't allow Twitter to be the next one. It won't be good. They will just do the same thing. Or they won't have to. So please, this should be the focus right now. Yes, TikTok bad bad. But ultimately TikTok is never the...",

    "text": "That's the generation. I think they just don't think making money is possible. And we're right. We statistically have worse economic outcomes and opportunities, and worse social ability than any of the past three generations, especially yours. And the interpersonal hatred doesn't come from you being wealthy. It comes from this shit, where you think the wealth is deserved, or an issue with our cultural generation. No, we were sold out. Our grandparents could work in a factory or in an office job and survive on one income, and have a house, and a family, and a car, and a nice food. Right? You could have all these things and have one income of a pretty standard working class job. That's true in the 70s. Now that is factually not true. The road to wealth is not through being a working class citizen. You can't do it. Right? So what was possible in your generation and your parents' generation isn't possible than ours. And so the stain is when you take that and you blame us personally. Fuck you. It's your fault. Your generation did this. Not us. And also we're not lazy. We work harder than y'all. More than us. More of us work. We're more educated than y'all. We're way more anxious about working than y'all. What are you on? It's harder to get into university now. University costs a shit ton more. It's harder to get a job now and it's sure as hell harder to survive after that job. Where is this idea that Gen Z is working less hard? If you have two parents that are working, two of us are working. That's twice as many. Right? That's the norm now. In the generation that you're in and the prior, it was possible to live with one. Who's not working? I don't understand this. And I guess I have to have a point with this. So I'll just say it's a lie. It's not true. Gen Z works really hard. Speak to them. Have you ever spoken to a person from Gen Z? They work fucking hard. We make all these videos. How hard is that? Anyway, um, but it's a lie to benefit the people who want to underpay workers. That's what it is. If you can say that workers are lazy, if you can say that workers don't work, if you can say that workers have no drive, then you can excuse not paying them. Duh. And you don't want to pay your workers. Because then you get to keep that money. You know what I mean? And so even though it flies in face of literally anything you look at, we're working longer, harder, for less jobs, for less pay, um, they're keep saying it. For two reasons. Number one, it's a lie that benefits them. But number two, it was true when they were growing up that they could be working class and become wealthy. It's not true now. And so they see us being working class and not being wealthy. They're like, what the fuck's wrong with you? You must be lazy. No, no, you fucked up a system. Yeah, that was y'all. Not our fault.",

    "text": "All the talk of the TikTok is a really important moment to hammer home the point that this generation needs to get into the practice of actively securing and controlling our methods of communication and mass media consumption. This is something that has gone under the radar but is extraordinarily important if you want a movement built for literally anything. So please focus. TikTok is not perfect. It's sensor speech left right in center. So does Instagram. So does YouTube. That's just controlled. You want to build a movement, build a community, build a place where you can actually talk and say and express views and make a view come from radical to normal. Like TikTok has, you need to control that space and nothing will ever be perfect. And the act of controlling and curtailing and securing a certain community and place will be a consistent practice. But that's the discussion we need to get into the habit of going. Red note to hilarious right? Obviously not a permanent solution. Blue sky. That is also good. And it's a step in the right direction. But it's not permanent. Blue sky, the servers still have limitations on what they can say. The benefit is they lock into the master dot network where we can control what is said. There's a discussion of a decentralized Instagram coming on. I think it's called Pixify. Get it. That's cool, right? But this needs to be a discussion when we do have reach, when we do have power to reach a lot of people. That needs to be the first message. If you can't reach me here and you still want to hear what I say, blank, blank, blank, and blank. For me, that's Instagram, YouTube, and blue sky. That's where I'm going to be. Instagram, YouTube, and blue sky. That's where I'm moving if TikTok ends. And that should be the first word out of people's mouth when they are building up a platform and when they have a platform. The first concern should not be how to maintain the current platform. But how to secure influence of people that build it up across. And the mass media is really, really good at this. And one media corporation goes bust, they just buy another and get a new TV show at all of the viewers just go over there. We need to take a habit of this because that's really powerful. If the people own the media, the people own the politics, the people own the narrative. And if that can be true, that's beautiful because the first move of every autocrat is to take control of the media. And so if the American people become inoculated and resilient to that act, we become much more inoculated to authoritarianism.",

    "text": "One day out, let's talk about the ceasefire. First of all, I want to address this kind of fact that is up to spin, which is that this is the exact same ceasefire deal that Biden offered in March, which is true. You can look at the terms and make it clear. And Biden was very proud about this, but why would you be proud, Biden, that you offered the correct terms and Hamas accepted it, but your allies didn't? That means the people that were stopping peace were the people that you were funding. That means you were stopping peace. And so there are a few narratives you could have about this, right? So you could have the narrative that Hamas had such an decisive military victory against Israel that they forced Israel into a ceasefire they didn't want. This doesn't seem likely if you look at the military facts on the ground. Something I do think happened was more America inside, which was the difference between now and March is Western public opinion changed. There was an ICC warrant. There's further in the ICCJ and massive sanctions in arms have come from certain Western nations and recognition of Palestinians have it. The public perception of Israel and the threat to Netanyahu's government, internationally and nationally changed. And so they were forced into a worse deal. That's a loss for Israel. Let's just say it as it is. This is a loss for Israel. And I think a huge reason that had happened was international pressure and lobby. But I also think on the American side there's something else here. Trump was running for office in March. And it was in Trump's best interest to delay a deal until after the election. Because that would be a major, according to anyone, domestic policy win for Biden. And according to the recent polls, it was a major sticking issue for a bunch of Democrats. Trump knew that. So I don't know. I know Trump was part of this negotiation. I don't know how much foul play there was. But I am very sure that Trump used any and all of his influence, due and undue to push for a ceasefire deal after the election. Now this is not necessarily him in opposition to Biden. I don't think Biden wanted a ceasefire deal that bad. Because Biden is kind of a right wing lunatic in terms of Israel. And he clearly wasn't that bothered about a ceasefire. He could have done it very quickly. So I don't think this was Trump working against Biden. I think this was both of them having certain sway and Trump using it a lot to push after the election. And now before the incoming presidency, BB wants to secure Trump's benefits and wants to make sure that they can maintain control. And Moss is very interested in preventing a Trump antagonistic presidency for obvious reasons. And the final kind of puzzle in this, although it's very complicated, this is American-centric view, is Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. They clearly had a lot to do with getting the ceasefire done. And I have no doubt in my mind that that came with assurances. And it's a good reminder that Saudi Arabia is very interested in normalizing relationships with Israel because then they will be able to get possibly a new program greenlit by the Americans and possibly F-15s, according to their previous requests for America in exchange for new normalization. So, looking back on this, this is a loss for Israel. Okay, this is a massive loss for Israel. They have to exchange their costages, something they never wanted to do. They claim these people are terrorists, then they're giving them free. They're not terrorists, but they claim that. This is probably kind of a Biden victory, but it probably also fell into his lap. This is certainly a Trump victory. I don't know how much he contributed to actually happening. I'm willing to bet he contributed to not happening a lot more prior to the election. The Qataris, the Egyptians, and Saudis, I want to know what they gave up. I want to know what they sold for this. That should be public, because they probably betrayed their people in terms of trying to get this deal through. And so, it would be interesting to see what they sold. And this is, depending on how it turns out, somewhat of a Palestinian win. October 7th was primarily a hostage swap, and they got a hostage swap. After 15 months of genocide, they offered this hostage swap on October 9th. Let's be clear. This is not a win in that sense. But in the sense of a diplomatic and political win of getting certain concessions for a miserable, it absolutely is. And so, while it is horrendous, the genocide Israel put Palestinians in. One should draw a little bit of hope from the political and diplomatic and possibly military abilities of Palestinians to require Israel's to follow about this much of the law.",

    "text": "No, Israel has not already violated the ceasefire. Here's what we know right now about the ceasefire. First of all, no, Israel hasn't already violated the ceasefire because it hasn't gone into effect yet. Well, we should absolutely be skeptical of everything Israel does from here on out and consistently. They have not violated the ceasefire, it goes into effect on Sunday. Second of all, BB has signaled that he does not like the ceasefire. He has said that Hamas blackmailed him to into it, which is wild, and it has signaled a fall of his wartime cabinet. But my analysis is that basically Israel will have to support this. Now that it has full-fledged American support, Katari, Saudi, Egyptian, and, you know, Palestinian support, they're going to be politically forced into it. There are also whisperings about Ben Gavir stepping down. Thank God that demon needs to be held to trial for his war crimes. So, ultimately, we will see on Sunday if this ceasefire holds. But there are diplomatic consequences if it doesn't, according to the Katari press release. They have a meeting with Qatar, Egypt, America, Israel, and the Palestinians in Cairo, following it to discuss diplomatic failures if it fails. And ultimately, if you want my opinion, I think it'll hold. I think it'll be a messy hold, but I think it'll hold. And I think the Palestinian authority will make moves to move into it, following a push for humanitarian aid. Maybe I'm optimistic. It doesn't really matter what my prediction is, but that's what the prediction right now I have is.",

    "text": "I sound crazy for a second about the ceasefire. I-I'm willing to bet, in about five years, we will get a release that Trump pushed the ceasefire into the election. I'd give it like a 50% chance of happening. I don't think it like a hundred percent happened, and I'm not saying I've evidence of this, just to be clear. But I do think we have a historical precedent for this happening. Reagan famously did it for Jimmy Carter. Nixon did it for the Vietnam War. He cheated twice once with foreign adversary. And the reason I say this, like especially in light of now, is because it's very clear. I mean, it was clear before, but it's even more clear now. The stopping point here was the Israeli side. Hamas accepted this deal in March. Israel has been dragging its feet very actively, and now it's coming out that Ben Gavir pushed even harder for them not to accept the ceasefire. And we know that Trump has been in contact with Benjamin Netanyahu, and I have no doubt in my mind that Trump would actually pat push for it to be pushed until after the election, because he knows that it would be a big win for Biden. Now do I think Biden really wanted a ceasefire? Eh, not really particularly, but I think he probably knew that it would help his electoral odds. That's my thing. He's not stupid, right? He knows the ceasefire would benefit. He just also doesn't actually give a shit that there's a genocide happening. But like purely playing politics, Biden probably did want a ceasefire, at least to some extent. He just wasn't willing to put the political ump of an arms embargo behind it. That would actually make it happen, put actually. So what we had was Trump's words, first Biden's words, and Trump's words probably one out because he ended up winning. And because he had Israeli politics behind them. Now is this crazy conspiratorial speculation? Maybe, maybe it is. And I admit that. Lock me up, put me in jail. I don't know what to say. Does it also have historical precedent in American history? Yeah, I don't think Biden's good on this. I just want to recognize what I actually think probably maybe happened.",

What he failed to mention was that Israel denied that ceasefire attempt. Hamas accepted it. And so before the narrative that Biden is clearly trying to push sets in, which is that this is because of America's military might beating down the axis of terror, I want to remind you, the reason the ceasefire failed last time was because Israel wanted to abuse, brutalize and commit genocide against the Palestinian people for longer. What has happened is the international pressure, the facts on the ground, and the material realities of Israel have changed, such that they are not as confident or capable to commit that genocide against Palestinians. That is a very different story than the one that Biden is attempting to push, but it is the one that is backed if you actually look at what happened. So remember, we must hold Israel to the ceasefire, but remember whose fault it is that it didn't happen earlier.",

Almost all of Biden's discussion is about how America's military might lead to beating Hamas down into having no other option other than a hostage deal. But this doesn't actually make sense when you look at the hostage deal. Where Israel is making a huge amount more releases of hostages than Hamas's. If this is about military might, if this is about them having nowhere else to turn like he says, why is Israel giving a shit ton of hostages away? Why could they just go in and take the hostages? Why could they just exchange a ceasefire for the hostages? I do know a lot of Hamas commanders and a lot of Hamas military weaponry was destroyed in this genocide. But I think Biden is actively lying to you when he overemphasizes the rule that that had in the ceasefire deal.

Basically Israel re-releasing a whole lot of their hostages that they are holding of Palestinians for 33 of the hostages Hamas is holding. There will be a cease fire and there will be a slow reduction, especially in civilian zones of Gaza of Israeli troops. The main bit of information we've gained is that there is a enforcement mechanism in Cairo of all of the parties to this agreement, which includes America, Qatar, Egypt, Israel, and Hamas. It's still unclear what those enforcement mechanisms that will be done in this meeting in Cairo will be, and there is still negotiation to be done in part two and part three of this agreement in which all hostages and all troops would be removed from Gaza to lead to a permanent peace, as is the goal of this agreement. We must hold Israel to their account of this agreement and their international obligations to the Palestinian people.",

    "text": "It's too early to know if Israel will respect this ceasefire or what the precise terms of it are. Israel is a history of disrespecting ceasefires both with Hamas and Lebanon. But if they do, I want to remind everyone who has spent the past 463 days fighting for an end to the atrocities Israel commits against Palestinians, that fight doesn't end just because Israel reduces its direct attacks of Palestinians. Palestinians have been under an oppressive, a par-thidal, genocidal regime for the past 76 years. And this is nothing but an opportunity to hold that regime to account. There will likely be a change in government in Israel, but that doesn't mean there is a change in regime in Israel. The issue with Israel is that it is an ethnostatic, genocidal, apartheidal regime. And nothing of that will change until Israel ceases to exist as a colonial entity. So this is fantastic news if it holds because it will lead to the ability to send in humanitarian groups. Look at the actual total impact, allow for refugees eventually to return and have an actual discussion on the international stage how to deal with this criminal entity. So the fight on the international front continues. We must still call for a dismantling of the apartheid regime in Israel just as we did in South Africa.",

Step one, which apparently Hamas and Israel have both agreed to, according to Tari sources, and Hamas sources leaked to BBC and Al Jazeera. Includes a release of Palestinian prisoners that Israel is currently holding. Most of these prisoners are considered hostages because they haven't gone through due process. So Palestinian hostages held by Israel and the release of 32 Israeli hostages held by Hamas. It includes a cease fire, so immediately stopping shooting, as well as a gradual reduction in Israeli military presence in the area. That's what we know right now. I will update you and we have more, but this looks like an uneven deal already. Israel is going to negotiate the fuck up in state phase two and three, but keep watching. And never forget the past 15 months. Nothing they can do can override that.",

After a year and a half of onslaught violence against Palestinian civilians, there will be a pause in the fighting and a secured release over phases of the hostages. The details are not currently out fully, I will update you as soon as they are. I just wanted to get this out quick because I want to remind you all. While this is what we have been fighting for for the past year and a half, it is too little too late. And the main functional benefit of it is finally we will have a breath to hold Israel to account for their war crimes. Never let them make you forget what horrors they put the Palestinians through. And so we are so happy that this will at least decrease the violence to some extent. We must never forget what they did and hold every single Israeli belligerent accountable.",

    "text": "So I've ignored the Pact of Umar when I said that the Arabs weren't converting by the sword. Let's look at what the Pact of Umar is. This is the full text. We have all of it. It's from Boston University if you want the source, but very shortly it sets out the agreement between Muslims and people of the book, who are Christians and Jews. And it sets out very clearly that the people of the book are to pay Jizia a tax of sane adult males, and they will receive protection from the Muslims. And generally, they're able to practice their faith, maintain their places of worship, and not learn Arabic or the Quran. Actually, they weren't allowed to learn Arabic or the Quran generally. So how the fuck am I ignoring the Pact of Umar when I talk about Arab imperialism in the area, which literally set out protections for Jews and Christians? And I mean, I agree they shouldn't force them to pay extra tax. That's true. Muslims are forced to pay tax as well, and at certain times Jizia was less than the tax that Muslims had to pay. But either way, right, in those cases that Jizia was more than the tax the Muslims had to pay, I think that's wrong. But that's what all empires do. And like imperialism is bad. I agree. That's kind of the point of this page. But my issue is when to justify Christian imperialism, and European imperialism, people point to the made up fucking horrors of Arab imperialism, and flagrantly lie about the atrocities that were committed. It diminishes the harms that European imperialism did in the area when they slaughtered Muslims and Jews in this area. And the Muslims actually take a shit ton of immigration of Jews because of how horrendous the Christians were. It diminishes those harms. And it is still to this day used to justify genocide imperialism and ethnic cleansing, like in Israel.",

    "text": "Polarization won't kill us the fascist will. Let's just be clear about that, y'all. Polarization is only an issue when a democratic political system cannot solve and address it. That's the issue. Democracy shouldn't just work when people are close together. It should work when people are far apart. The issue is when one side actively only serves the elites. The other side is trying to actively empower the people. That's what democracy is best at. And best suited to do, debates about how to empower and represent the people. But fascists aren't having that debate. So no, the left moving further to the left is not destroying our democratic system. That's not what it is. I mean, we've had communists in this country before. What killed our democratic system was when fascists, authoritarians came down and killed them because we've killed communists in this country many times. We've censored communist speech habitually. We've thrown communists and socialists in jail. We've done that. That's what's killing our democracy. And that's not polarizing for me to say. Right? If it's polarizing, then the other side is authoritarianism. I'm fine to expel them from our political process because all I'm saying is we should stop censoring socialist speech. We should stop censoring communist speech. We should stop allowing the CIA to murder communists and socialists throughout America. That's what's destroying our democracy. And until that stops, we're not ever going to be the problem because we're not the ones that have a multi-billion dollar agency actively working against our enemies. That's not what's happening. The CIA isn't actively doing siops against every right wing organization in America. They don't. Actually, many of them have gotten funding from CIA-like organizations. On a more basic level, polarization can't conceive of leaving the issue. That's how democracy works. The issue is when people don't believe in democracy. And that's different than not believing in the current institutions that propose to be democracy. The Senate is not democratic. Me not believing in the Senate is more democratic than people who support it. The Supreme Court is not acting democratically. Me not believing in the Supreme Court is me being democratic. The House of Representatives is not being democratic right now when they vote against Americans interest. That is not democracy. That's liberalism. Two different ideologies. Liberalism is the appeal to those fundamental institutional values and respects for institutions. And there's a place for that. But that's different than democracy and the values of democracy. And we should separate those and remind ourselves of that. When authoritarians appeal to those liberal values, but then defame the actual consequences of those liberal values, they are only doing that. So leftists who actually believe in democracy have to find a middle ground on those liberal values that they themselves were violated in their own way.",

Funny about this, is first of all, I don't like the CCP, but second of all, if you're going to attack them, don't attack them for their economic gains, they've crushed it! By almost any metric, their growth is exponentially better than America's. Their wealth inequality is lower than America's, their GDP per capita, has been growing at a higher rate than America's, their nominal and real GDP growth for the past 30 years, has been higher than America's, they've eliminated extreme poverty and their net poverty rate has gone down much quicker than America's, their literacy rate is higher than America's, their home ownership rate is higher than America's, what metric are you talking about? Just how many billionaires they have? Is that what you care about? Or defense? Oh, okay, defense, because their agriculture is doing better than us, their technology is growing at a higher rate than us, like it's literally just defense and they're doing really well on that. Now, just to be clear, they have slowed down in the past decade, that's true, right? But they've slowed down to about American pace, right? And the issues with the CCP is that there are one party state with questionable democracy, right? And violence against minorities widely reported by certain human rights organizations, that's the issue with the CCP. But the issue with the CCP is not their economic growth. No, it actually is the increasing wealth inequality that has followed that economic growth, but that's not your critique here. And what's interesting is the sectors they push money into are doing very well. That's why their free market is doing very, very well. A huge portion of their free market received venture capitalist funding from central government funding. Chinese Communist Party owns a huge portion of even the freely traded market shares. This is a bad critique, guys. Like CCP economy pretty fucking good, at least compared to the American one. CCP domestic policy, human rights violations, boo, boo, bad, no. CCP economy? Yeah, pretty good. And finally, this is not how ideologies or judging ideologies work. If we just wanted to say, well, I'm going to judge the ideology by what people call themselves, then Iraq should hate democracy and freedom because we killed a shit ton of their women and children in the name of democracy and freedom. Right? No, no, no, no. We actually test if like these ideas are good by when they were actually implemented, what their consequences were. And when America acts socialist, we do pretty well. And when we act mega super communist or capitalist, sorry, we do quite poorly. The same is true for China, brother.",

    "text": "For your favorite time again, let's watch Israeli propaganda part two. Antizeyanism has become the latest brand of anti-Semitism. Being as ionists means you support the existence of the state of Israel in our Jewish ancestral home. I so let's just start out lots of anti-Semites as ionists. The majority of Zionists are Christians. A lot of Christians want it Israel to exist because they wanted Jews to be kicked out of their country. So I think, hear me out now, Zionism was a new form of anti-Semitism at its founding. But also, let's just be clear. Yes, Zionism is about having a Jewish state in the land of Israel. I don't support that because I don't believe in a Muslim state or a Christian state or Hindu state or Buddhist state anywhere. Because I don't believe religion or ethnicity should determine nationality. I think that's wrong. I think that's led to the evils that you're keeping Jewish people safe from. You know what I mean? Let's continue. Saying that being anti-Semitism is not anti-Semitic, I feel like it's kind of a conversation stopper. It's basically saying Jew hatred. If you're not... Okay, it's not. If you're not against Jews but you're against the only place that grants them safety, I don't believe you. Okay guys, that's fucking crazy. Because no, Israel... Let's just think about this. Israel is somehow both the most victimized, attacked, and blamed country in the world and also the safest for Jews. These two things can't be true at once. But I want to remind you propaganda only has to be true to its ends. So the reason it's the most attacked and blamed is because then they can be brutal to the people attacking them. If they can blame Palestinians for being totally unreasonable, totally barbaric and evil, yet that justifies killing their kids in their minds. But if it can also be the safest place for Jews, then you taking it away is doing violence to Jewish people. But both of these can't be true. And yet in some way they are, as it relates to propaganda. The actual truth is what makes Jewish people unsafe is weaponizing anti-Semitism to justify the maintenance of a theocratic, ethno-static. Colony. Funded and supported by anti-Semites. That's what makes Jews unsafe. Just to be clear. Just to be clear, the Nazis wanted to expel Jews to Palestine. There was a stated plan for that. The British, when they supported the Jewish homeland in Palestine, the only Jewish MP voted against it. The original American supporters for Israel, do you know the bloudest, most strong supporters for them? The American evangelicals that hated Jews, the same people that were part of the KKK, they supported Israel at its founding. The thing that is making Jews unsafe in this situation is this propaganda, which completely waters down a very real thing, anti-Semitism, into any wavering in undying nationalism to a fucking evil state. Stop.",

    "text": "Let's talk about the just read theory of it all, because I made a joke about them and they got really angry. So, my critique is super simple. If you say just read theory, you are not helping anyone. And if you don't think anyone says just read theory to someone who's trying to understand leftist ideology or thought more, scroll, this isn't a critique of anything you know then, that's fine. But to the people that have heard this, that have engaged with the leftist, had a discussion, and then you don't know something, or you don't understand something, and they go just read theory at all be good, or they say, oh, you're actually like not sufficiently a leftist because you haven't read blank, blank, and blank. That looks like an issue to me, and I'll tell you why it looks like an issue to me. Because, theory, as like hardcover books, there is like a physical inaccessibility to some people for them. Like severe dyslexics, like myself, without treatment, or without like special teaching, simply can't engage with them. Right, there are just limits to what you can engage with as a person to some extent. So there is like a disability active here. But there's also a class thing here, which is like once again, I was able to get treated for dyslexia because of my upper class brain, like upbringing. And I've been able to engage in academic thought and literature following that. So like ableism, classism come together, and to some extent, there are people that are functionally illiterate in this world trying to engage in leftist ideology, but they just can't read a book. And certainly not a book at like college level, lack style level. Like there are people that exist in that world, and I'm not saying all poor people can't do it. That's not what I said, right? We're showing a like no, I'm saying there is just like a crossover of ableism and classism that cause some people not to be able to access some like to access this certain thought in this certain form. And so when we give ourselves a license to dismiss because people haven't engaged with that certain form, we are giving a license to enable those harms. You see what I mean? And so all I was saying was that we should not have a license to dismiss people's views, arguments, ideologies, understandings, or interest in learning simply because they haven't read such and such theory. Do you see the issue is that it's missile, not not the theory. And as alternatives, I suggest that we validate where people are actually getting their information and understanding today. By and large literacy has decreased in America, but media consumption has massively increased. People are learning things. The left just doesn't own those things. Like mass media, people are learning things from that. Social media, people are learning things from that. Video essays, online lectures, right? Think pieces made by fucking 13-year-olds with their dad's computer. Like these things exist. They're just different media forms that we should develop to. And we should say, oh, you know, you read it from this article. Do we think that's a helpful thing to learn from? It might be yes, it might be no. This video essay, this lecture online, I consume a lot of lectures online. And I like, I think a lot what I learned from there is very, very helpful. About even to what I would get from a book. But it's very difficult as I always saw a video doing it. Do you know what I mean? Like there's this cultural license to dismiss, depending on where information, ideology, or understanding came from. And there's also this cultural hyper-fixation on someone reading down to theory just from like a book. Rather than engaging with it like we do in the 21st century, which is in multimedia presentations. And also final critique. I did say, no, I won't read your white boy of a choice. And people in good faith and bad faith critiqued that. So I just want to clarify that. Yes, I'm aware people of color, right? Theory. I'm very aware of that, right? My main focus area on this page is like the Arab conquests. Like within the past few months, it's been Palestine. It's been these issues. I've read a lot of people of color theory on these issues. Third or perspectives and imperialism. Like I study public international law to some extent. Yes, I'm aware, right? Obviously I am. My point with that comment was to say that the worst offenders of this harm that I'm talking about, the dismissal because of people's certain engagement with certain media are people that shove like marks and angles and lend and down your throat. They're obsessed with that, just to be clear. So I was talking about certain engagements that I've had and I've seen other people had. And I've understood to be a larger cultural phenomenon. If you've not understood it, be a larger cultural phenomena. Great. Fantastic. If you haven't seen this issue, thank you. Fantastic. I could have been more precise, but that's also just like how short form video works. I can't be that precise. So apologies for misunderstandings. And apologies for being precise with my language. And if you don't think you're a fender of this, great, you don't need to learn anything from this video. But if you have dismissed someone because they haven't read theory or you have thought lesser of someone's ideas because they haven't cited like one of the favorite 10 like leftist authors that you know by name, do sit and reflect on that. Sit and reflect on why we have to say, I read an article rather than I saw a TikTok. Why do we have to do that? Right. The Atlantic lies just as much as like the motherfuckers that come up on my fur U page. It's an outdated system. And we should have media literacy. But that actually means we have to engage with the media. We can't just dismiss it. Slay.",

Middle Eastern is a American, Western construction. It's not an Eastern construction. It's not a construction that came from like the natives. It was entirely made by the imperialists. And if you spend two seconds thinking about this you could figure it out. The Middle East, okay, what is the West or what is the center here? The center in this idea would be Western Europe because that's then we have the Eastern block countries and Russia which are the Near East and then we have the Middle East and then we have the Far East. I mean obviously this all got messed up because what is now the Middle East used to be the Near East because that took like two Europeans that was the Near East and then America made it the Middle East. See what I mean? Because they wanted to demonize Russia. All of this is made by the imperialists. Oh shut up, like",

They did invite us to talk about their religion. They said all they wanted to do was talk. All you need to do was read. And then I talk and I say, well, I think this is racist. I think this is sexist. I think maybe you're advocating genocide in this chapter and they go, you never say this about Islam. But first of all, I would. And I did. But second of all, the Muslims aren't the ones knocking my door. Asking me about their religion, asking me to join their cult. That's not what's happening. When they do that, I'll give them my opinion. But until then, you're the one I'm judging. So I will keep Jesus's name in my mouth as long as you make me.",

The amount of cops involved in right-wing militias in America is extraordinary. And anyone that has known anything about the cops or looked into this issue should not be surprised by any means. But the point I made in the other video, which is that if you want to slaughter minorities in America, you don't need to join a Christian terrorist organization. You can just join the military is just as true for the cops because the police force originated with slave catchers. They were literally formed to brutalize minorities. But there's also a weird counter argument because actually they are both joining the cops and the military and joining these right-wing militias. Like, it's actually interesting. They don't think they're doing enough racism. Somehow they are the inland military, which you should be the only definition of police that you see and the outland military, the military. And they're still not convinced that they have enough arms. That's fucking psychotic and we should be horrified. And we should find the name of every single one of these and make sure, guys, that they are not co-conspirators with a registered terrorist organization like the proud boys.",

And so were a lot of the Christian residents of Jerusalem. It's fucking insane to me that I was taught in my high school and my middle school that the Arabs were some violent conquests that would force jizzi attacks upon their peoples as if that's not what a fucking empire does. Whereas the Crusaders literally went through and committed mass genocide wherever they took over. And when the Arabs took Jerusalem from the Romans, all of the Jews had been exiled or subjugated by the Romans. Why the fuck were we taught that Jews lived a second-class citizens under the Arab Empire, which they did and isn't acceptable, but not that they did under the Romans? Why? Like, I get it, guys. All imperialisms bad, and I agree. But I cannot fucking stand the lies that I was told by the American fucking education system, which are literally covering up mass genocide by people that we still call back to. The Roman Empire is still revered in America. The fucking invasion of Iraq was called a final crusade. And that worked on the American people, the crusaders committed mass genocide. I'm still mad about it. And maybe, you know, we should all heal and recover and grow. And I will do that. The second they stop fucking lying to children about history to whitewash the fuck out of what is taught and demonize brown people. Then I will heal and grow. Until then, I'm gonna be fucking living. Oh, and my point is like, stop doing their job for them, guys. Come on now. Come on now. Everyone knows that Arab imperialism was like bad. Not everyone knows how fucking horrible Christian imperialism was.",

Have you considered that you can interpret a lot of these, a lot of different ways, to justify a lot of different things? And that Muslims also disagree with how certain terrorists have interpreted their holy books? Maybe we've maybe the reason you think these are different is because you want to demonize Muslims and you don't want to demonize the Christians that have used interpretations of your mythos to justify violence? Maybe? To please stop. I mean, it's a no true Scotsman fallacy because there's no way for us to tell who's a true Christian or not other than just you, I guess.

That's a starting point, y'all, and I want to respond to some of the comments I got on that, because there were some good points. Which, first of all, this does not mean Russia good or China good or Iran good. Right? It just means that you're starting point with why you think Russia's bad or why you think China's bad or why you think Iran's bad should be hmm. What is the American narrative about this? And how is the American narrative about this influencing how I think about these other things? The starting point for me is that most people in power are going to be bad. It's very difficult as a good person to come to power. It's because power is inherently going to reward the selfish. And that's why I start with American bad because America has the most power. You see how that works, everyone? Also, these are starting points. Every situation is different. Every situation has people and ideologies and material circumstances that differ in change. But if you want a starting point, starting with the most powerful and then seeing how they acted and how that served their interests and then how people reacted, right? Like Iran is largely a reaction to the American and Western imperialism. And that really helps explain what's going on currently. That's a great way to start. That's how I approach foreign policy quite often. And it's helped me be in line with a lot of the new occurrences that are coming. And I could go on literally forever about this because I talk about foreign policy all the time. But I do three things in foreign policy. If America did it, they probably did it for bad reasons. If America influenced this country, that influence is probably way larger than I think it is. And their politics are probably at least in large part of reaction to that American influence. If Sinn Fein says it's bad, it's probably bad. If Sinn Fein says it's good, it's probably good. I like Sinn Fein.",

And y'all should be making it too, because the people can make interesting, engaging, and diverse content. Have you ever seen the Deloitte ad? The corporations are not capable of it. I have never wanted to become a luddite quicker. Then when I saw an old white man tell me about how much he loved making coffee in the office. Whole leash it.",

Because during that time there was no conversion by the sword of people of the book. They were made to pay an extra tax, and I'm not saying that's right, but that's what a fucking empire is. You conquer people and make them pay tax. If you want to have this discussion about empire and imperialism in that territory, be fucking honest. And while you're at it, stop referring to it as the Islamic conquest. It was the Arab conquests. We don't refer to the Spanish conquest as the Catholic conquest. We don't refer to the English conquest as the Anglican conquests. The only reason you're referring to that is because you think somehow Islam responds to colonialism or imperialism more than Catholicism or your or Protestantism, when historically that's totally untrue. And finally, those other empires did convert by the sword. Millions of natives were killed because they weren't Catholic enough. No Christians or Jews were killed because they weren't Muslim in this time.",

So let me just walk you through why you're wrong Because yes, they will replace one CEO with another But that next CEO will be a little more scared and the board will find have a harder time finding a CEO That's willing to put their life on the line to do evil shit You know what I mean like if it's really easy to do evil shit without threatening your own life more evil shit will be done Whereas if the working class makes it dangerous to hurt the working class It will be less likely to hurt the work that you see what I mean Let's keep watching if we are condoning violence as a solution to something that can be solved through the political process Then we are headed down a slippery slope to a third world country I'm not gonna continue that clip because he just goes on to be super mega racist But let's just respond to it first of all no the political system is not working and violence is what happens when the political system isn't working And I love how you a person that doesn't support the political solution is like why can't they just find a political solution Through this we tried we tried and then dipshits like you prevented it So if you don't like this allow the political process to express the will of the masses or get the fuck out of the way But just to respond to like the racist reference of third world countries America did a shit ton of those revolutions in third world countries We funded one or both sides of those revolutions It wouldn't be a Downgrade in America's morals and aversion to violence first of a revolution on our home front It would actually probably be more honest because at least we would honestly know that Americans were doing it Rather than hiding behind ten Arabs So to put it in short you are demonizing the working class whose only solution Has become violence because you view that violence to be below America despite us doing that violence every day And despite you being the fucking reason that violence is the answer that they have reached for Because once again every person always would rather solve this politically But dipshits like you who don't support the policies to solve this are The reason violence is the only answer that some people feel they have left So before you actually just never do this I don't give a shit even if you do support universal health care right it's super xenophobic and racist to say that America would fall to those Sad third world countries if they committed violence as if we don't do that all the time But beyond that support the right policies and this won't happen It's very simple",

And Saddam Hussein was like, oh, you want us to get rid of them? Let's go in the desert and blow up a shit at them. And then America was like, no, now we need to go find all these IDs that we have and verify that they're blown up. And so we sent in a guy to go tick off the IDs and he had 97% of them.

He outlines how American foreign policy in his book is integrally related with its economic goals including natural resources like oil. And I just want you to critically think for two seconds. Yes, America is one of the largest oil giants in the world. But that means that our economy is highly dependent on the price of oil, because not only do we use a lot of oil to make secondary manufacturing goods, but we also export oil. So if the price goes up, then our exports get more powerful and the manufactured products that we produce from it get more expensive because other people can't produce them at cheaper costs. So Americans foreign policy has always been to destabilize or control the territories that have a lot of other oil. Like Iraq or the territories around the places that have a lot of oil. Like Iraq. Everything America does for foreign policy has to do with oil. Just think for two seconds before you come.",

    "text": "This is a real discussion I've had. Is suggesting that the Middle East is unstable because of American imperialism taking away autonomy from Arabs in the Middle East? No, I've decided it's not. Because the thing taking away their autonomy or the bombs being dropped on them. That's what prevents you from making a stable state. Actually, there have been many times that the Middle East has been almost democratic in many places and those got overthrown a lot by Western imperialists. And I could go on about how racist and bigoted this whole thing is. But let me just point out, this is actually a common general critique of leftism, which is that we're overly materialist and fail to understand how individuals affect history. But I want to reference how this critique is almost only levied against leftists who are advocating for marginalized groups rather than everyone else who seems to have a perfectly good grasp of material analysis when it's the oppressor. It's literally the same critique as saying, well, we shouldn't give handouts to poor people because that's insulting to their ability to make it on their own. No, it's not. Right? Is it insulting to rich people to allow them to get their inheritance from their parents? No. Like poor people don't get to be humans in such a way that they don't even deserve to eat. Right? It's somehow insulting to their dignity to just to like eat. And yet it's not insulting to rich people's dignity to receive an inheritance. And then the opposite is true. Right? When Israel's attacked, then Israel gets to be super emotional. And maybe, yeah, maybe they make some mistakes. But wouldn't you, if some of your civilians got killed? And same thing with rich people. Rich people, you know, they get to be super, super fucking crazy. They can do drugs. They can make mistakes. They can fail in businesses. And they can go to fucking space. And well, yeah, I wouldn't you as well. If you had a few billion, you would do dumb shit too. But poor people can eat. Like, like, I don't even know if I'm articulating this the best. And I'll develop on it. But there's this like leveraging of dignity and autonomy by liberals and conservatives. I think in conservatives it's bad faith. Liberal sometimes it's better faith. They actually mean it. Where they somehow think that understanding why people do things and why people fail. And putting the onus on their mother being bombed. Or their whole entire society being destroyed. Or then being born into a bad family is somehow insulting to their autonomy. When what is actually insulting to their autonomy is the failure to provide realistic material conditions for them to actualize what they want to do. Like, that's what's insulting. And it's insane to say no we should keep the material conditions the same to protect their dignity. There is nothing dignified in starvation.",

For thousands of years. Historically, let's just talk about Jerusalem. When Muslims ran Jerusalem by and large, Christians and Jews were allowed to worship, prior to the Crusades. When the Christians went into Jerusalem, they slaughtered all of the Jews and all of the Muslims. This isn't to mention the programs that led to the Crusades and continued well after them, or everything that happened in World War II. I don't want to compare atrocities. I think every single live-lost is absolutely horrendous. But to attack Islam on the basis of certain acts against Jewish people. And fail to recognize the atrocities that Christians have acted against Jews is nothing but politically motivated.",

The victim, the perpetrator, everyone that cares about the victim and perpetrator to the forefront rather than some ephemeral idea of justice that doesn't even have to benefit anyone. Because our current understanding leads to some victims begging for their perpetrators not to be killed. Begging for their perpetrators not to be in jail. But our system forcing it upon them. Which benefits no one but the people making money off of this slave labor of those prisoners.

And by that I mean, Israel successfully expelled, separated, or oppressed their minority, such that they are actually a minority now, as opposed to the time of partition, when Jews made up a vast minority in this territory, and still got a majority of the land through partition. Whereas in South Africa, the whites never were able to partition away the black people away from their country, like they wanted to with the Bantou stands, and establish a majority government, like they wanted to. And I know I'm being a little sarcastic here, but it is correct. The next step of apartheid is separation and then genocide. It goes ethnic cleansing, separation, genocide. That's the way it was going to happen, and Israel is on the genocide side right now. Okay, now that we understand that I want to respond to one other conflation in this comment, which is that somehow Palestinians claims to the land only goes so far as Islam, as if their whole entire humanity is tied up in their religion. Ignoring the fact that historically, ethnically, their cultural background can be traced back to as early as the Jews, and many Palestinians are in fact converted Jews. They trace their lineage often back to Jewish people that converted to Islam, often peacefully, under Muslim rule. So if they don't have claims to it, why the fuck did the Jewish people that left have claims to it? Their culture traces back as long? They often are literally from the same descendants, and just to know they often have closer genetic ties to the territory. It is racist and bigoted and xenophobic to conflate the entire Palestinian identity with the religion of Islam when many Palestinians are not fucking Muslim.",

At some point that obviously changed, but he was put in power because of America, and he stayed in power because of America. It's very clear America doesn't give a shit how he treated his citizens. They helped him treat him that way. So this is a reminder that we slaughtered millions of Iraqis and Kuwaitis, many women and children for no good reason. It was to maintain America's foreign presence in the area and continue to destabilize the Arabs, but that's not a good reason my loves. And that makes George W.

I agree these are horrible crimes. Horrible horrible crimes that society should do everything to prevent. But what's important here is that my critique and many others of the death penalty has nothing to do with how horrible the crime is. I think murder is horrible. Right? I think if you murder a bunch of people, that's absolutely atrocious. But I still don't think the death penalty should be in the state's repertoire. I don't think I trust the United States justice system with the power to, number one, prevent expulpatory evidence from coming about. So finding later that someone's innocent. Or number two, putting someone to death. Because the American justice system is way too flawed to trust them with that power. And I want to point out that these two cases which are often pointed to as the exceptional cases. I agree that death penalty is bad, but maybe in these few cases, right? Or actually the cases where those critiques might be the strongest. Because of the government and the societies use of such cases to be mega racist and mega homophobic. And why I say that is because some of the few cases of actually mass systemic false accusations of essay were super racist. They were white women who were caught having consensual and of course with black men. And then to prevent them from being shamed in a racist society, said it was unconcentral and then those black men were put to death either in jail or by the mob. And second of all, there's a vast history of accusing queer people of being child predators. And there have been lots of examples of them being falsely accused and then once again, killed by the government or by the mob. So I understand that it's very natural to look how horrible these crimes are and say absolutely these people don't deserve to live. And what I'm going to disagree personally more early, I believe every single human being has value, but that has nothing to do with the argument here. I want you to say, okay, yes, they don't deserve to live, but the US government shouldn't have the right to kill them. It hasn't earned that trust from you. And you should make it earn that trust well before you give them that power. Because if they don't have the trust, but they do have the power, we all know they're going to misuse it because they have. Finally, I want to just validate the point, which is that essay and CP are wildly under-posecuted. And so when I'm talking about not increasing punishment on these, right, I, there is a chance that I looked like I'm advocating that they get prosecuted less harshly. That's not what I am talking about. I agree the government and the whole society should put more time energy resources and respect into prosecuting essay and CP. I agree. But instituting death penalty number one won't help. And number two, it doesn't actually respond to this super racist and homophobic way that it has been leveraged in the past.",

And that's bad. I mean, I should read people's perspectives and take them for what they are as original human beings. But it's very difficult when you've seen like hundreds and hundreds of videos literally paid for by the IDF written by Israel promoting certain ideas and verbatim sentences and then you see them repeated in comment sections. And that's actually the goal of misinformation, right? The goal is to have you not be able to trust and engage with anyone so that developing conversation can happen, right? They want to make it impossible for anyone to engage in conversation rightfully because you'll just accuse the other one of being a propaganda bot and they'll expect you to be a propaganda bot and everyone be in bad faith. And so it's important that we recognize Israeli propaganda but also like engage with humans as humans. And that's the difficulty of the internet, I guess.",

And that caused a bunch of people to give me a bunch of places that we could move. Hypothetically not affected by American foreign policy, let's read through them. I think the most audacious one on this list is South Korea, which was literally founded by America, like it's literally an American colony. Um, the American military is still the technical military of South Korea. You're telling me that South Korea, which is imminently related to the United States, is it affected by American foreign policy? Are you shitting me? What are you on? Okay, let's continue reading. Two of them, Switzerland and Lichtenstein, I can't physically move to because I don't have a right to. I mean, they're one of the hardest places to immigrate into in the world. They don't let anyone immigrate into them. So, okay, Austria's part of NATO, Ireland's one of the strongest foreign allies America has, and Singapore also a direct military defense alliance with America. America affects everything.

Like the anti Arab hatred, the anti Arab racism that is in these comments are absolutely absurd. People invade each other. It's happened throughout history. And if we really want to settle the books, a lot of minorities did a lot better under Muslim occupation than they did under Christian occupation. That's just how the history actually turns out. Not to say they didn't commit atrocities. That would be entirely disrespectful to what happened. But if we're going to settle the books, it's not looking good for the Christian.",

Also, it's impossible to move to. Like, you can visit Switzerland, but have you ever tried to move to it? No, I mean, you haven't. But it's nearly impossible to. It takes 10 years to naturalize, which is twice as much as almost any other European country. It is insanely difficult to get work there. It is one of the most expensive countries in Europe and they've really hate immigrants. Like, even white immigrants, they're not even like, you know, they're not like America in that way. They hate all the immigrants. They don't want anyone in there. So you got me there, y'all.

    "text": "Did you know that anti-Semitism was specifically coined as a word to sound more scientific rather than emotional or religious? It used to be eugen-hoss, hatred of Jews, which is accurate. It's an emotional or religious hatred of these people. But then it was anti-Semitic, and it came along with what do we do about the Jewish question when we put the Semitic people? And I want to first note, it's nonsense. I mean, there are many Semitic people that aren't Jewish. Mainly, people let's be Arabic. Arabic is a Semitic language. But that's besides the point, the point I'm making is that this language was actively used by anti-Samites to start asking the Jewish question, to start having an academic-like framework for addressing these people's rights to live and exist where they lived and existed. I think if we're not to repeat these harms of history, we need to learn the effects of this language. We need to stop asking the Palestinian question. We need to stop asking if it's one state or two state that treats these people like they are the problem for existing where they have existed for millennia. And that's why I like to see the rise of the language that's actually accurate, anti-Palestinian racism, because that's what's going on. That's why we're treating these people as a problem. Not because they are, they've existed there forever. It's that America and the West hates Arabs and hates people we think are Arab. This is known. We're still salty from the Crusades. And we could talk about this in a huge amount of context how language is done, but I wanted to specifically point out this example because it is prime. Asking the question of where the Palestinians belong or what state they deserve or exactly every political instance of their existence. Rather than recognizing that this conversation is seeping in racism and xenophobia and imperialism, is being used to justify or at least justify turning a blind eye to the ethnic cleansing of the people we're trying to solve.",

    "text": "I got called anti-Semitic again. You know what I said this time? That American bombs have killed millions in foreign countries. I sh- you know that's what I said. Here's the text, right? He said the casuality anti-Semitic statement, and then the statement that I said was that millions have been killed by our American made bombs in other countries. And that's anti-Semitic. And I want to respond to this because anti-Semitic is very real, and it exists, and it affects my thinking, and it affects many, many people's in this world. It's very ubiquitous, and it's very important that it's word keeps its meaning, and isn't co-opted by a fucking imperialist state defending itself and its war crimes. It's very important to keep its name. So let's break this down. What I said was that American made bombs have killed millions in foreign countries. That's a factually true statement. It has. He assumed I was talking about Israel, and then assumed I was being hyperbolic because not literally millions have been killed by our Israeli bombs. Close? I mean, it's getting close, but whatever. Let's say it was hyperbolic. What that actually would be would be anti-Israel bias. Anti-Israel bias is different than anti-Jewish hatred, which is anti-Semitism. Two different things. One's a country, one's a people's, different things. And second of all, which Amr arguably pissed me off more, is he assumed that is what I was talking about, just Israel, which is a wildly ego-centric, like to think that all critiques of American foreign policy boil down to just Israel is wild, and it actually leads into this thinking, which Israel promotes this ideology, this idea that somehow leftists only critique American foreign policy when it talks about Israel. Which isn't true. Obviously not true. I critique American foreign policy everywhere all the time. It just so happens one of the largest impact factors right now is Israel. And so it actually shows two main methods that Israel has used to co-op this word, which is to immediately knee-jerk reaction. Whenever anyone says anything about Israel negatively, it's anti-Semitic. I mean, that is just the rule. But then even larger, to paint this picture, that any critique of American foreign policy, well, you're only really talking about Israel. Well, why do you only really talk about Israel? I don't. Well, why are you being hyperbolt? Like, you see what I mean? They're pigeon-holing leftists into saying you only talk about Israel, even though that's not factually true. And then critiquing them for only talking about Israel, which once again isn't factually true. And second of all, wouldn't be an issue. And then saying any critique about Israel is anti-Semitic. It's threefold and it's flagrantly false. There is anti-Semitism in the pro-Palestinian movement. But this isn't helping. Because if we use this word to refer to any critique of Israel, or my god, any critique of American foreign policy, we're going to be here all day. And no one has time for that. Let's use this word right. It's widespread. It's really easy to see examples of anti-Semitism in the world. Let's call them out. But please don't leverage this because it will end up hurting. It is not going to end well. It never does. When countries conflate, hate against one specific peoples and critiques of their policy, it always hurts the people they're suggesting they are meant to protect. It just hurts those people and let's stop doing it. Because I care about the safety of my Jewish friends and family, I care about the safety of my Jewish brothers and sisters. Israel, please as well.",

The bureaucrats that were fired because America went in and dissolved Iraq state. Later became al-Qaeda who became ISIS. I mean direct line there, y'all. And so I got a few questions on my last post talking about American interventionism regarding the New Orleans attack. And we still know no if they're correlated, but if they are, of course I'm gonna talk about American foreign policy. That's why it exists. And it's a super complicated history, but we know at least one thing. If America had an invaded Iraq or if America had invaded Iraq and done what a bunch of other conquests do, which is keep the state and just replace the people in it, ISIS probably wouldn't exist. And they certainly wouldn't be attacking America. This isn't an ideology versus ideology thing. This is a don't invade a fucking country, leave a bunch of people unemployed who are perfectly capable of making a state, and expect them not to attack you. That's just dumb. And finally, do not let this example be justification for a repeat of what we did. You will see people do it. You will see people try to use this as a justification to increase America's presence in the Middle East. Remember every time you hear this, this is because of America's presence in the Middle East. If we had not done a bunch of expensive useless deadly imperial wars in the Middle East, this would not be happening. It would look different. This would not be happening. So don't let anyone ever convince you that it can justify anything other than America pulling out more from the Middle East.",

Like there are a few people over here that have crazy far-off beliefs, but that's just to find how far away from the mean they are. And if there are more of them, the mean shifts over here. So like, what was extremist on the right? Like, 10 years ago has become less extremist, because there was a rise of that following Trump. And the reason they're talking about Luigi Mancino, and he being a rise of extremist support for him, is because supporting him, or not being bothered about his action, is a threat to the status quo. It's a threat to the current center of the overton window. So I just want to put that out. I mean, extremism, bad good, whatever. The rise of extremism is just a society changing. The rise of extremism is just a society changing.",

You don't get radicals when you don't kill their mothers. You don't get radicals when their economy's doing okay and their children have education and they can eat. You don't get radicals when you don't suppress pro-democracy movements. The best thing America could conceivably do for the world is to stop bombing shit. We currently have a pact with Saudi Arabia and Jordan to prevent any pro-democracy movements. That's how we control those states. We've suppressed pro-democracy movements in Iran and Iraq and almost every country in the Middle East. That's a role. That's what we do. I mean, democracy is dangerous to the American policy in the Middle East because that leads to them owning their oil. So I agree. Let's change our policy to not radicalize and not cause terrorism in other places and that starts with us actually fucking believing in democracy. And that starts with us not destroying the lives of millions of people. We need to learn the right lessons.",

It came to power following massive American and Western intervention. Sometimes in support of it, by the way, you remember, we supported in Iran in the 1970s. This is all connected babe. And if you just want to blame the brown people, you do that. But that's totally useless and flagrantly racist, by the way. But it's just going to lead to more attacks on American soil.

    "text": "Talk about manufactured consent and false flag operations, especially in light of this recent terrorist attack in New Orleans. Manufactured consent in this context is when America commits a terrorist attack itself, on itself, against the American public, to get the public to support an imperial war. We did this with the Spanish-American war very famously. And a lot of attacks throughout a history have been accused of being a false flag operation. They're flying a different flag, but they're really Americans. And my general view is we need to be aware that this happens. We need to be aware that the CIA does in fact do this. I mean, we have documented evidence they do this. But also, on any given attack, we just don't know. Okay? And so I'm desperately unwilling to label any given attack manufactured consent. The most powerful thing we can have is to say that one people's actions or an individual's actions never justify an American imperial war. Because that will only, regardless if it was false or true, create more terrorists. And so this is one of the cases the facts actually don't matter because we'll never know them. Nothing justifies an imperial war.",

So, you know, East Germany, state, the United States, one state, that then has states underneath it that identify as states, but like, on a global scale, we would call them provinces, because they're really cause-playing as a bunch of states that came together. And I really now one state. But a republic is just a state that is run by its people as opposed to a monarchy, or a theocracy, or a kleptocracy, or stuff like that, right? So a republic is a general term for a state that is generally not a monarchy. So it's more so, like, a constitution type or a government type than it is, like, as opposed to being a state, do we understand that? So please, like, it is a republic and a state.

This counter brings up three places, Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan, and says, okay, maybe Iraq was bad, but the other two find. So let's start with Iraq. We killed on a conservative estimate about a million Iraqis for no reason. No reason. We knew they did not have weapons master's instruction. You know how we knew they had didn't have weapons master's instruction? Because we were the ones that sold them it, and we knew that it was expired. And we had sent in a guy to look up the blown up weapons master's instruction, he found 98% of them. We killed them for fun, guys. That's what happened. We destroyed Iraq for cheaper oil, but that war cost us more than the oil. So we killed them for fun. So we then moved to Iran, which is indefensible even by American standards Obama apologized for overthrowing Mosadeg. The who would be the democratic leader of Iran. And the reason we know it's horrible is because it led to the R.A.G.C. So is this like a pro-IrGC post? The reason the R.A.G.C. came into power is a response to the pro-America Shaw that was installed following Mosadeg. Okay, so the last one we have is Afghanistan. Really? We funded Al Qaeda. Who later became the Taliban? We funded the people we thought, guys. Are you telling me that we're right for having funded the people that we thought? You're saying that was a good move? Are you pro-Al Qaeda? What? Like this is... What? No, of course we were wrong for funding Al Qaeda. Are you kidding me? Are you kidding? We funded Al Qaeda against the communist and then Al Qaeda turned against us. Obviously, because obviously they would. No, our policies in Afghanistan, even barring the mass civilian casualties and deaths that are entirely unnecessary in Afghanistan, we funded the people we're fighting. Are you telling me that we were right? No, of course not. This is silly. And actually, the goal of American policy is to be this type of incomprehensible where we fund the people we eventually go against and the people we go against work with us to fight against these people. It's actually written down. It was literally Kissinger's goal to make insane foreign policy. There is no way to morally justify creating chaos in the world. And that has been American foreign policy since Henry Kissinger had power. The only moral goal you can conceivably point to, which was his goal, was increasing American power. But at the cost of a couple million Arab lives. So no, at least I don't think it's worth it. And you're batshit crazy for pretending we tried to do anything else.",

I think some of those actions are violations of international law. The concept of armed resistance of oppressive people I contextualize within international law. And just to be very clear, taking hostages is never acceptable under international law, targeting civilians is never acceptable in international law. The use of sexual violence never acceptable under international law. But that is not all that Hamas does. And I unilaterally condemn when they do that, as well as every single organization in the world. I hold to that standard. You can test me on that. But they also target Israeli military places. That's valid. They also fight back against occupation forces. That's valid. So I think this is a bad paradigm and it's a paradigm that's explicitly used by oppressors to trick people into condemning unilaterally resistance groups. Things are not monoliths and everyone in the world commits crimes. We don't need to hold the resistance group to never committed crimes. To say that some of their actions are justified in valid.",

A huge portion of the Arab land. All up here and here is Arab. At least to some large extent. But most importantly, the Jewish state was comprised roughly of 54% Jews, 46% Arabs, and was meant to be a Jewish state. The Arab state was almost 95% Arab. What they did is they carved around the Jewish sections and gave all the land they conceivably could while maintaining a Jewish majority to the Jews. That's what happened. And that means they did the exact opposite for Arabs. They took as much land while maintaining a Jewish majority. And also, the Jewish state was meant to be a Jewish state. The Arab state was set to be a secular, multi-ethnic democracy. Interesting. What happened is an extraordinary minority of mandatory Palestine was given a rough majority of the land, some of the most productive land in the territory. And then we cannot forget that by 1948, most of the Arabs that were meant to live in the Jewish state were refugees. They were kicked out. This wasn't unfair to the Jewish people. I mean, they were a minority and they got a majority of the land. These things don't go together.",

    "text": "What can Israel be an apartheid if all the races have the same rights? Well, my friend, they don't. Not when you ethnically cleanse people specifically on the basis of their race, put them into ghettos and deny them citizenship on the basis of, once again, their race. Which is precisely what Israel has done. You know what that yellow is? Those are the Jewish settlements within the West Bank. The Red? Those are the Palestinian settlements within the West Bank. The Red? Don't have citizenship. But if you're Jewish and born in the yellow, you do have citizenship. So first of all, that's the biggest issue, which is that they deny citizenship on the basis of race, right? If you're Jewish, anywhere you can get Israeli citizenship. Whereas if you're Palestinian, even if you convert to Judaism, often they deny you. But second of all, even with citizenship, there are two tiers of citizenship, Jewish and non-Jewish. According to the basic laws of Israel, there are rights exclusive to Jews in Israel. Every international organization disagrees with you. I wonder why?",

    "text": "Jimmy Carter, former United States President and Famed Humanitarian, is dead today. And I would just like to remind you all that just like every other United States President, he was a work criminal. And so most media outlets today will be talking about his humanitarian work, which they should. It was amazing. But I want to take a second and reflect upon the Iranian hostage crisis, where he was simply unwilling to accept America's responsibility in thwarting Iranian democracy at cost of keeping 63 Americans hostage in Iran. Put very simply during the Iranian Revolution, a bunch of students invaded the American Embassy, hoping to find documents showing that America thwarted its democracy previously, which it had and which they did. But in the process, they caught 63 mainly CIA agents shredding up those documents that they were doing because Iran was the center first in the CIA in all of Asia. And so those students held those CIA assets primarily hostage and said, America, all you have to do is apologize and recognize to the world that you overthrew democracies multiple times in Iran. And Jimmy Carter was unwilling to. And this went on for 444 days. In fairness, Jimmy Carter apparently did have a deal on the table with the Iranian students. But Reagan, likely allegedly, called them up, sent them over arms or weapons to delay that deal until following the election. So there was absolutely dirty dealing on both sides, but this is a reminder how aligned both of those sides are in US foreign policy. Neither of them were willing to take the very easy option of recognizing and admitting American involvement in overthrowing democracy in Iran. One of them was just a slightly better diplomat and one of them had a vested interest in keeping the hostages in place, winning the election. So today could be a reminder, a person can personally be a pretty good guy. Jimmy Carter, I think, was pretty chill. You know, he seemed pretty good. And his later work was absolutely amazing. But when you engage yourself with the American Imperial machine, it is almost impossible to come out of it without extraordinary blood in your hands. And in this case, Jimmy Carter absolutely perpetuated the imperialist goals of the United States Empire.",

Don't get me wrong, they do hate trans people, but it more has to do with the fact that they have something to gain from hating them than actually unmotivally finding this to be an issue. And then we have to ask the question, what do they gain? Well, they gain a scapegoat. And it's the playbook that fascists have played by every single time they've come around throughout history. Find a small, small minority that you actually can pass really effective legislation in an oppressing. Blame all your problems on it, and then pass that legislation that oppresses them. That way, your voters see you actually addressing a problem. The only issue is that problem is fake. But it works when it's contrasted with an ineffectual liberal party that can't actually get anything done. So if you just make up a problem, trans people existing, and then solve that made up problem, at least you got something done, even if we kind of aren't sold on it being an issue. And it distracts from them serving their oligarchic overlords, with tariffs that only benefit those oligarchs and regressive tax rates.",

So the name of their country is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Great Britain is Great Britain, so the greatest of the British Isles. So there are the British Isles and then the biggest one is called Great Britain. It's like Grand Canary. And then Northern Ireland is a geopolitical term for a gerrymandered part of the Irish island. And what actually happened was the Kingdom of Scotland merged with the Kingdom of England and they called themselves the Kingdom of Great Britain even though they comprised more than Great Britain. It was the Kingdom that the people who lived on Great Britain controlled. But then they colonized Ireland, changed their name to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, which didn't even make sense because if we're going to start including other islands, we should include islands like the Isle of White, the archipelago, whatever that's nonsense. And then they got beat back to Northern Ireland. And so they changed it to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which makes even less sense. Now we're not just including another great island that we included. It's a geopolitical term for a little piece that we held on to. Why isn't that just like every other part that the United Kingdom of Great Britain took over? Right? Like if we want to start naming them by the geopolitical terms, it's the United Kingdom of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. But no, no, no, they name it by geopolitical terms and also geographic terms. And then we're not even going into Guernsey and Jersey and we're certainly not going to go into Gibraltar, God forbid. And I could go on for a very, very long time, but people get really mad at me about this. So enjoy.",

    "text": "Did you know that Israel was not only one of the largest allies of partite South Africa, but to this day, how it treats Palestinians is largely inspired by how partite South Africa treated the native black population? This is best shown through the treatment of the Bantu stands that South Africa made, which were effectively fate countries within South Africa that South Africa tried to make for the native African population. They were native reserves, which by the way, were inspired by America. Everything in color is a Bantu stand. So those are the reserves for the native black population of South Africa. Notice something about them? They're separated. And the reason they're separated is one to break up the African population so they couldn't fight back, but two, because they were actively placed on really shit land next to population centers, so they would have to effectively provide very cheap, effective slave labor for the white African population in those population centers. Remember what these look like? We'll come back to it, but this is where Israel comes in, because during these South Africa came to the international community and said, hey guys, we have this land. We're going to give them a government, we're going to give them a territory. We'll define a population, and we will recognize them. They're independent states. They can do what they want. Please make them recognized. And the whole international community said, uh, hell no, we're not going to recognize your native reservations, because that would enable apartheid. The UN Security Council passed like four resolutions against it. They supported Lisu Thu and not recognizing it, and the UN General Assembly also passed resolutions condemning it. And magically, not a single state in the world recognized them. Only one got close. You want to guess which? Israel. Israel had two of the presidents of the Bantu stands, visit Israel, and they promised at least one of them, according to internal correspondence, that they would recognize it soon. Israel at this time is also providing aid and training to South Africa to continue apartheid. And Israel got a nice little special shout out by the UN Security Council for doing this. They were the closest allies South Africa had. They were actually known for this practice of buying arms in the name of Israel and then selling them to South Africa, bouncing them through Israel to bypass the widespread weapons and bargows on South Africa. Okay, so we've covered how Israel and South Africa were really good homies back in apartheid South Africa times. But what did Israel learn from this? Well, that's when I go back to the shape of these. What does this look like to y'all? Hmm, hmm, that looks familiar. These are right next to population centers actively carved up by the population centers of Palestinians on really shit land and actively separated and ghettoized because all that in the yellow between those populations are, you guessed it, Israeli settlements. And you may look at me and say, well, surely they aren't doing this so obviously. Well, have I got a story for you? There was actually this guy called Paul Grineski who wrote a book called Attract towards the Future and it was about Bantu stands in Israel. He verbatim said that the Zionist movement should move towards Bantu stands for the Palestinians because quote, separation is not complete within one country. He recognized the same thing that the apartheiders in South Africa recognized, which is that subjugation of the natives can't go on forever. But if you separate them, give them their own land, but continue to deny them their equal rights in your land, you can use them for cheap labor and cause them to eventually die out, which is what we're seeing in Gaza. So Israel should be seen as nothing but a more complete apartheid state and that calls for the exact same solution as South Africa apartheid. The complete dissolution of the apartheid government, a one state for all peoples of that territory and an immediate and continuous international pressure campaign including full economic diplomatic and political embargoes.",

    "text": "So I've recently had a little run in with some leftists to think that digital actions can't do anything. And they don't seem to understand the concept of guerrilla campaigning. So let me explain. I recently made a video calling for people to send an application to the Israeli Embassy to make it really, really hard for them to hire a social media manager, which you can still do by sending a CV and a resume to here. Use anonymous information they like to dox. But I got some interesting comments being like, women and children are dying and this is what you're doing. Are you really proud of this? You think this is doing anything? Yes, let me explain. The goal of a lot of these actions are very simple. Make Israel's life harder. You want to hire someone? We're going to have you interview 20 million pro-Palestinian people. You want to give a speech? We're going to protest outside of it. And this has two major effects. It costs the money. It costs the material money that they could be spending on bombs. Like, that's an actual real effect we have to consider. But second of all, and more directly, it shows the public that we don't accept Israel as a part of normal life. They shouldn't be. They are a criminal state committing mass genocide. And to treat them with normalcy, to allow them to continue their work online, allow them to continue as a normal state is wrong. And if at every single turn we can pull media coverage to show that they shouldn't be treated as such, that shifts public opinion. We're the crazy extremists fine. But that pushes the overt in window closer to where it should be, which is a centrist being like, I don't think Israel's evil, but I also don't think they're like normal as a state. Great, that's what we want. And those comments that leftists leave actually are a really good way the CIA likes to shut down movements like these because they work. It's called brow-beating, right? Or moralizing. Oh, what you're doing isn't nearly enough, so don't do anything at all. Oh, it's just so horrible. So actually you not doing everything conceivable isn't ever going to do anything stop right now. But don't buy into that. Resistance can be fun. It can be dangerous and we should have respect and dignity for that. But it can also be small. It can also be sending in an email to a noya worker at the embassy. It can be protesting outside so that they will not be able to do their work in peace and quiet. And if that's all you can do, do that, my god. And if you can do more, great go find more to do. But don't you dare suck the fun out of what we can do. Because revolution and resistance will only succeed if there is joy in it. And just kind of messing around is both a great way to motivate and mobilize an average person. And often can be quite efficient because people get creative. So get creative. Don't tear down other people's ideas, right? Get creative. Think about it. And at every single turn, let's make Israel's job harder.",

Because while the Jewish people do not have to prove the morality in any way should perform, it is relevant to know that while the Jewish population of apartheid South Africa was quite small, they were widely overrepresented in the white resistance front in South Africa. Jews fought hard and in large numbers against the racist apartheid state of South Africa. No, Jews did not run the apartheid system in South Africa, Israel did.",

And I'd be so worried if a bunch of people with any amount of these experiences, who maybe had problems with Israel, got a hold of this address and sent in applications.

I mean, the pro-life movement literally came out of the right wing racist evangelical churches in America. The rise of Southern Baptists in the South, imminently led to more organized racist actions by the Republican Party slowly taking control of the South. Churches are community. They are meant to be community centers where people organized and mobilized action for good. And the right wing took that and used it as a mobilization center for their own horrendous ideology. And they were able to leverage the charity that churches do to promote their ideologies. They have homeless shelters, not for gay people. They have camps, conversion, and they feed the poor unless you're trans. Churches are and have for a very long time been places for the right wing to mobilize. And the left needs their equivalent and they do in some, but not most.",

I don't use the language of barbarism basically ever to talk about places that have been oppressed by the imperial court. And I do that very actively. And so should you. When we call something animalistic or barbaristic or unsipilized, that was language that was intentionally created by the empire to otherwise and marginalized, places that they wanted to take over and exploit. Civilized nations is still used in international law to refer to places that were colonized, specifically to marginalized and to some power of them. And while I agree that it would be better for this language to have never been created because it's fundamentally dehumanizing and otherizing. The best thing I can do is use it in a way that is actively subversive and reverses it to point out the fact that if we are to use and dehumanize anyone because of their adverse use of violence, it will be the imperial court that is using exponentially more violence than anyone else.",

That's what you think is bubbling here. This is a great example of how liberalism and most status quo ideologies see the reaction as the problem rather than the thing we are reacting to as the problem. The problem to them is not the violence inherent in our country. When we see death penalties played out by states, when we see hundreds of thousands of people thrown in inhumane conditions in prisons, when we see thousands die unnecessary deaths because the health care industry is unregulated and privatized, when we see millions killed by our American soldiers or our American made missiles in other countries, that's not the problem. The problem is when we react to that. This is the issue and the downfall of liberalism. If they are unable to see what we are responding to and rather they treat these little bits of resistance violence as arbitrary products of the mind-road of social media, they will fail to align with the people. And the right wing fascists provide an answer. They say we recognize these. We see what's actually boiling. The health care industry, evil, you know why it's evil? Immigrants? You know why it's evil? All this diversity. I just want to be clear, the left does have an answer to this. The issue is the ruling class, the owning class. When capitalists own everything, she gets worse. You fight imperialist wars. You deny poor people health care. You throw people in jail to use them as slave labor. The left has an answer to this. The dangerous thing is so does the right. And it's fascism. It's blaming modernity. It's blaming the other. And liberalism allows for that narrative to creep in. When they say there's no problem, other than these crazy reactionaries, other than these domestic terrorists, there's no problem. People just need to pipe down on social media. You're leaving room for the fascists. The sooner the working class comes together and says no, no, no, it's not the immigrants. No, no, no, it's not these people in other far off countries. It's the owning class that is denying our health care claims using us as slave labor in prison, using us to fight imperialist wars to maintain their control. The sooner they reject this fascist narrative and reject the narrative, the status quo that they're actually no problems. The problems are just kind of people being mean online. The sooner both of those very dangerous ideologies will lose.",

So let's run through that pretty basically. The first and easiest thing you can do if you've suddenly come into an awareness that you've more in common with your common worker than the ruling class is to join an organization like Food Not Bombs, the DSA, or any other mutual aid organization in your area where you can meet other people who are interested in helping your community. Think of this community building as building the infrastructure for the actions and goals that we want to achieve. In campments this year wouldn't have been possible if some community hadn't existed in the first place. Another incredibly helpful route is unions. If you have a workers union, look into it. If you have a tenants union in your area, look into it. Immediately to mind there are also debt unions and credit unions. Get organized.",

This obviously speaks to grave injustices on behalf of our justice system, but it's important that it's probably okay that they're using it in this case. Because we all agree that the justice system is probably going to treat him unfairly, considering his victim was not a member of a marginalized group or a member of the working class, but was a rich white male CEO, who the justice system was literally made to protect.

It comes down to very basic principles, which is number one, I don't trust the United States government ever to make that decision. Because number two, they have historically shown, they are not trustworthy for that because it disproportionately is used against poor people and people of color and other marginalized groups. And then there are secondary reasons like it being more expensive than life in prison. And then we could also go into recidivism, which is overall, it doesn't decrease the likelihood of the crime. But these are all very systemic critiques that can't conceivably apply to an individual case, right? And the action of an individual against a person that is objectively oppressing and harming him is very different than the actions of a system against an individual.

Why do we need this many people? Why is the mayor there for a one person uniliving? And it actually does show two things. They're out of control. They're losing, they're scared. He got under their skin. And second of all, they don't know how to deal with the public support. The public recognizing the violence that is the status quo and not being bothered about responses to it. And so keep on NWPD, you're doing such a good job. Thank you so much.",

And the feds know that, and they're betting on you not knowing that. But you know what we do for martyrs? We have fucking feasts for them. We have days celebrating them. We put them in God-damn-painted glass. And if they brutally murder Luigi Manjone, like they are brow-beating all of us into feeling bad about him doing for the CEO that caused the death of thousands, they will have no more, moral high ground, even pretend to stand on. So of course, I hope, I hope, they do not, because no one deserves the death penalty ever. But if they do, it will be a massive mistake. And pull out the fucking food because we feast in y'all.",

But also guys, seriously, the fact that the feds are getting involved with a single murder case, the fact that they're charging him with terrorism and like nine counts of things is insane. It's super rare for the feds to get involved like that of just civilian to civilian, right? He wasn't a cop, he wasn't a like army politician, he wasn't, he was just two civilians guys. The only thing that differentiates this targeted killing which happens all the time in America because we have a massive gun problem is that this guy was just super rich.

A great example is when he violently threw out the money changers from the temple. With a whip, y'all, that is clearly politically motivated violence. But on a greater level, he was tried and convicted for sedition against the Roman Empire because he was bringing together a group of oppressed people that threatened the power structure of the current Roman Empire. There's a great article written, I'll just read a little bit from John's Fraser. From the man you know as Jesus Christ was radicalized, at a desert training camp in the mountains of Judea by an extremist preacher called John, the Baptist. Unlike the wild man John, Jesus was more of an interest type. Superficially at ease with the mainstream society, he talked a lot about peace, but sometimes the mass would slip. I come not to bring peace but a sword he once admitted, and like John, he too hung out with lots of known terrorists, like Simon the Zele. The reason Jesus is great is because his resistance.",

Importantly, the Supreme Court did not grant injunctory relief for Tiktok, which they requested, which means that Tiktok, as of right now, is still getting banned on January 19th.

And this is on the backdrop of a general prohibition on force in a territory. So it is a right clearly carved out by the government which enforces an otherwise prohibition on force. Private property rights are an ideological right under capitalism. They're not just facts of nature. And they're unilateral and they're not self-asserted. They're rights the government recognizes.

Damn right, that was the T-shock, so the Prime Minister of Ireland, speaking about the closure of the embassy and he's exactly correct. They're doing this as a media stunt and it actually doesn't make any sense. Ireland is one of the wealthiest countries in Europe per capita. To cut themselves off from Ireland is to cut themselves off from a good portion of Western world money. And this is a good reminder. Ireland was under illegal occupation by an external empire and an external people for hundreds of years. And they fought back and they succeeded and that solidarity doesn't waver. And it's still not because the Irish people know what it's like to be under a settler colonial entity, taking their land, enslaving their people, brutalizing their children, and erasing their culture. Ireland has a long lasting solidarity with the Palestinian people and it is insane to watch Israel fumble again and again and again in their relationship with Ireland which once again has a very good relationship with America, very close relationship with England and is one of the wealthiest in the EU. So it's, you know, we got to take a win where we can, y'all. We have one country that's doing good work. They're not perfect. Their policies aren't perfect. But damn, that is good.",

But God forbid someone attack the ruling class, then they're dirty, dirty teasants. Let's just be clear, that's not what it is, right? It was a targeted, unaliving. Rightfully, it is murder, right?

Because who do you think enforces someone's right to private property? The whole entire idea is that the government will allow you to assert your right to this and then will protect your right to it. Anything else isn't private property, it's ruled by force, different system guys. So if you consider yourself a capitalist, you also have to be big government. You just think the government should do certain things your way and leave certain people alone and then enforce against certain people. And how that actually looks is the rich get the benefit of the government, they have more property to protect, and the poor are the ones that is enforced against. That's the system that you make and you can defend it, you can say it's necessary, but don't say it's natural. And certainly don't say it exists without government.",

But this person makes a fantastic point, which is that even logically, Republicans are consistently the people that believe in what we would call positive rights, right? rights to things from other people. And the basic example of that is abortion. Almost every single abortion discussion or debate or disagreement comes down to the question of whether we force women to give their body to a fetus, we allow them to deny that fetus, their body. The question is whether the fetus has a right to the mother's body. And it has always been the pro-life resposition that they do. There's very little other way to describe abortion in a genuine, honest way. So y'all bit the bullet. Keep it down.",

There's this example I heard I think who's Brennan Lee Mulligan, who said people don't ask why twice. So in Star Trek, when you say they go light speed, why do they go light speed? The warp drives. Why do the warp drives allow for light speed? Dylithium ions. A lot of political debates go that way. Republicans feel super, super smart if they say, oh, don't you know free health care isn't over, right? Because rights can't provide for other people's labor. And then there's no further justification for that secondary proposition. They feel like they got you because you said a clearly repeated mantra, and they had like one other set of logic.",

I want to remind you, this doesn't matter. If you believe that people like him don't deserve to go to prison. Not that people should do things like him, but people like him shouldn't go to prison, then your opinion on his family or his political beliefs shouldn't change. If you're a perception from everything you have actually seen about him from him, his Instagram, his Twitter, his actual friends coming out and speaking, that he seems like a pretty chill guy. That probably shouldn't change as the media gets a bigger control of this narrative. Don't let them win.

It would also mean that the Turks are anti-Jewish and thus, Israel is justified in invading Turkey. And actually they would be justified in invading the United States of America because once again the United States of America in 2019 and 2020 funded the people that are now running Syria. This is not how international law works and it's not how it should. If it was, any country could invade almost any country on a huge set of allegations.

It gives a voice to people that are systemically, actively and legally, voiceless. Overwhelmingly, the people in those prisons are either mentally ill because they were denied sufficient physical or mental healthcare, impoverished, or a marginalized identity, all of which compound to make the healthcare issue exponentially worse in their cases.

It can also be true that Syria should not be used as a political football between the world's superpowers to gain control over that territory or destabilize that territory. Unequivocally, that is the game that led to these rebels gaining control. And it is the same game that has led to destabilization of that whole territory for at least the past 70, 80 years.

I don't think they're guilty. This is a fundamental right we have because of the nature of jury trials. And I beg of you, use it well.

Tennessee passes this very reasonable law banning hormone therapy and puberty blockers for children. Meanwhile, we... Ah, there it is. You've no clue what this case is about. Because no, the Tennessee law didn't ban puberty blockers or gender affirming care for all children. It just banned puberty blockers and gender affirming care for gender change care. Or more accurately, if you were born a female and wanted to have gender affirming care to be a male, it was not allowed. But if you were born a female and wanted gender affirming care to be affirmed in being a female, then you could have it. And you know what that is? That's discrimination. That's sex discrimination, which is unconstitutional. So later in this video, you go, there's no constitutional right to these cases. Well, you're right. There is no constitutional right to this medication. But there is a constitutional right not to be discriminated against upon your sex, which is what's happening. If you could get gender affirming care to be affirmed as a male, if you were a male, but not if you were a female, you are being discriminated against by the law on the basis of your sex. You're meant to be the legalists and realists and constitutionalists. Know the Constitution!",

Jury nullification is the process by which a jury finds someone who there's strong evidence for finding guilty, non-guilty. Now why would they do that, you ask? Well, what if this jury just had a strong reason to believe that the law that was passed was unjust, or that this particular case they wanted to condone? And it's also a good time to remind you that this is true in every jurisdiction in the United States due to our right by jury. And that it is impossible to sanction a jury for finding the incorrect verdict. So people of New York, time to be really cool.",

If you are a film pro that thinks in order to maintain the purity of the original series, be that star war star trek, now wicked whatever, right? They have to make it non-political? You didn't get the source material. You didn't understand the assignment. Because all of that, in its original form, was fundamentally, at least in large part, political commentary. That's what it was, right? Star Wars was political commentary. And if you're a Star Wars bro that gets mad at any new political commentary that new Star Wars films or new Star Wars shows are coming out with, you didn't get what you claimed to know the best. And that's not you being like, pedantic or nerdy, that's you being wrong. And actually understanding what you claim to be elitist about, less than everyone else.

And everyone across the working class is more than welcome to join. We want you to join. If you're heartbroken about this election and are worried or scared about what will we come of communities you care about or people you love and care about, join the networks that are trying to help them. Not continue fighting for the party that failed them, the Democratic Party. The best place to start is local. I mean, if you have a local food not bombs, if you have a local DSA perhaps, if you have a local organization where it just leftists and revolutionaries are getting together, go meet people, see what they're doing, see what organizations you have. If you have a mutual aid organization or a collective care organization, join it, put your labor into that. If you have a tenants union or a trade union, you can join. Join them. They're doing incredible work right now with rent strikes or collective strikes or collective bargaining. These community care networks are going to be the best defenses we have. If, now it probably will, the whole entire force of the federal government feels a lot more comfortable and unilaterally organized to crack down on especially minority communities that they want to oppress and harm. And at the very least the support structures that we have gained from what amount of neoliberal reform we have had in this country will be decimated. And so building that up from the ground up with genuine good faith communities is one of the best defenses we have. I'm going to make more videos on this, but this also includes content creators. Content creators, if you feel like you put all of your efforts into this election and now it has become meaningless, go look at what people outside of electoral politics have been doing because it has impact. It has importance and also build a platform. We want to build an all to lift proper proper and a pipeline. We want people joining our side because the right has their gloves off. We need to take our soft to.",

Once again, I ask you, do you know what the IMF does? Or at a most basic level, how do you think the EU works? Do you know what happens if an EU country derogates from its EU obligations? There are enforcement mechanisms within that treaty. There are also real actual, real consequences for dictators who are indicted by the RICC. There is an unfortunate bias that those tend to be from the third world that get enforced, but there are still real material consequences. Like, there's a difference between saying, okay, the Americans tend to get away with all the violence and crimes in international law, and saying that international law doesn't exist. And the valid critique is to say that actually international law is America forcing their will upon everyone else. But that would still make it law. And saying it's not law is just ignoring all of these actual real systems that actually exist in the world.",

What I mean by that is the right wing has a bunch of money and they have vested interests in how to use it correctly. They spent millions of dollars learning how to use it correctly. We have the benefit of hindsight. They've already done the work. For example, for example, Heritage Foundation has spent millions and millions of dollars of how to get messaging, lobbying, what lobbyists work, how they can contact politicians, what people they can call up to get money from. What actions are effective in getting policy done? All of that doesn't just come naturally. Money doesn't just flow to the specific projects naturally. There's a lot of money spent determining how and in what way they can have this impact. And obviously when you apply leftist ideology to this, you get different consequences. But the tools are quite similar. And at least this is a starting point. Looking what Heritage Foundation does, copy pasting it and making it fit with our ideology will work. It's what Israel did.",

    "text": "Why does America not have to follow the arrest warrant against Netanyahu? Put simply because he's not a signatory to the treaty that empowers the ICC. Put simply, if the International Criminal Court wants to tell anyone what to do, they have to accept that the ICC has the ability to do that. And America used to be part of it, and now withdrew from that treaty, and so can't be held accountable to it. This does not mean if Netanyahu enters America, they still can't arrest him, and it doesn't mean they actually don't have an obligation to. They still would have an obligation to arrest him, not under ICC reasons, but because of the ICC, the International Court of Justice, they could preemptively arrest him or preemptively try him under domestic law, implementing international law. So he's clearly violating international law. He's clearly committing genocide, committing mass atrocities as Palestinians, America could and should hold them to account and arguably does have a legal obligation too. But the arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court doesn't change any of that for America.",

Here's the signatories of the Rome Statute, the empowering Statute of ICC, and the green are all the people that currently they have jurisdiction over. The orange are people that used to be signatories of the Rome Statute, but have pulled out the red, never signatories. The yellow, they've signed, but they haven't ratified, which means that they've signed the treaty, but their internal, domestic government hasn't ratified it, so it doesn't go into effect yet. So yeah, importantly, if you're in a green country, that means if a person who has a arrest warrant against them by the ICC enters their territory, your country doesn't have the ability has the duty to arrest that person. There can be international legal consequences for failing to do that.",

Even if you think this doesn't matter, please, for the love of God, do not go on the internet and your whole entire point be that this doesn't matter. Because if we say it doesn't matter, if we can see it doesn't matter, it won't matter. But if we use whatever political power it does have minimal, whatever your opinion is, against every other political power in the world pushing to continue this genocide, then we at least gain that little amount of political pressure. So simply, if we say it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. If we don't say it doesn't matter, it has no negative effects, and we get the power that it does have. So of course, keep working on other things. Keep pushing. Keep marching, yelling, screaming, doing whatever you can using the wherever political pressure you have. But this is good, and I need you all to at least pretend it is. Because if we don't, you'll be right, and it won't matter.",

And yes, corporate connections by definition have capital. They have social capital. They have political capital. They have physical capital. And that gives them political control and power. The reason we don't use corporate connections is because in using them, we would be defeated in our purposes because we're opposed to them. Right? Like if we tried to get Apple to help us, the strings and conditions that would come across with that would completely undermine the point. But it's a helpful point of leftist analysis to note that in fact they are effective at building power because then we know what we're fighting and we know what parallel structures we can use to build power against them. There's this weird pattern of like idealism within like leftist spaces, especially online, where suddenly we can't admit that things work even if those things are evil, which is entirely against the whole entire background premise of leftism as a materialist endeavor.",

Surely we think that we should legitimate any structure that was literally made directly in response to the Holocaust to protect our civilians and the world from such atrocities forever happening ever again.

The first and most important one is that if he enters their territory, they have an obligation to apprehend and arrest him and hand him over to the egg. But importantly, in the UK at least, the citizens may be able to hold their country to account for this because the administrative code, while not legally binding, is legally considered, obliges the government to follow international law. This means if the government fails to follow international law, we may be able to take him the court and force them to. Second of all, this strongly strengthens the case that, at the very least, discerral is committing some form of war crimes according to the ICJ. As these two bodies, the ICC International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice, oftentimes do not contradict each other. And just for our friends, all of the green countries are the ones that have the obligation to arrest them. And arguably, any troops from all those green parties now have an obligation to arrest them.",

I live in the UK, and importantly, this means that if the UK government fails to apprehend either of these two criminals, when or if they visit, then the UK government has both violated international law, but because international law is domestically applicable to the government in some instances, have violated domestic law, and we need to hold them to account.

I just slowly kind of grew into the identity. And it gained meaning, understanding, and different experiences as I grew up. In a similar way, leftism just kind of came to me, fit into what I understood and how I was. And because of how fundamental it is, I actually really don't view it as an identity. I just think leftism is correct. I view as an expansion of very natural, like human empathy, natural human reasoning, and I can contextualize other identities within that framework. But yeah, I was raised liberal. I mean, my parents raised me in New York University of the Church, so I was always open to ideas of empathy, democracy, etc. But then they naturally formed into a larger, more cohesive worldview when I started getting into relationships and when I started reading little bits of political theory, but not that much, and started talking about real politics.

On the right, jokes that are misogynistic or racist or sexist used to be very, very unacceptable and slowly leech their way in from like 4chan to Reddit to Twitter to Instagram as more and more acceptability happened. If you could make a sexist joke, you get the defense of saying it's a joke while being able to test the social limit. And so if the left can push that on the left as well of it's acceptable to joke about how evil America is in their periphery, it's acceptable to kind of believe that maybe we shouldn't be doing blank and blank and foreign policy.

If you aren't already engaged with your local, organizing mutual aid, tenants unions, other leftist organizations that exist around, and you want to do these really big things, do these huge movements, get organized first, because it'll be easier.

But I just want to tell you all, like, there is infrastructure out there. There are communities out there that have been doing this work. And if you are excited and you're mad or you're angry or you're worried, that's real and valid and important. And it needs to be channeled into really effective communities, because we have good ideas here. But a lot of the time we don't have the structure or the infrastructure really to get them out in an effective way. With Palestine, it was built, right? We had operational branch and operation past the hat. That was very impromptu and very effective. But now that work has been done. And now we have that infrastructure. And now we need to weaponize it and maintain it to maintain an effective list to store organizing. So please don't feel like you're alone here. Don't feel helpless, right? Go out, find communities that are working on this and join them, because this is exciting. And it should be exciting if you're a leftist organizer, even if, fundamentally, it's very, very scary.",

    "text": "I've got an incredible amount of comments saying that the left is fascist. From the same people telling me, I don't know what fascism is. So let's just start. The left can't be fascist. Because fascism is by definition a far right ideology. So either we aren't left leaning or we aren't fascist. Like that you can't have either. And when we say Trump is a fascist, we don't just mean Trump bad, right? Trump bad for a series of reasons. But he's specifically a fascist. And this is from the Holocaust Memorial Fund. They define fascism as an ultra-nationalistic, authoritarian political philosophy. That is nationalist, militarist, pro-economic self-sufficiency to anti-totalitarian. Leftism in America is none of these. And it by definition opposes communism and socialism and pluralism, which are the very things that you are decrying that we are. I'll make another video explaining why Trump is a fascist. But guys, please, before you throw these words out and accuse us of not knowing how to use them, know how to use them.",

    "text": "Sure, so what's the difference between a leftist and a liberal? We're talking very strictly, ideologically, what we mean is a liberal is a person that wants to reform but maintain capitalism in the capitalist structure, a leftist is a person that wants to get rid of capitalism in the capitalist structure, either by reform or revolution. So what you see from liberals are things that ease the harms of capitalism but never actually fundamentally challenge the implicit issues with capitalism. And what you see from leftists are direct attacks of the root causes not the symptoms of capitalism. So like from liberals you might see subsidies from the government to buy a first home or a lot of social policies because a lot of those biases came from imperialism capitalism and they're symptoms of those things but they're happy to say where anti-racist, anti-immophobic, etc without attacking the systems that created them. Whereas leftists you would see things like actual land reform so that we don't have to subsidize houses like that. Or an end to imperialism and new imperialism so that new structures of racialized oppression don't come into existence.",

And interestingly, you've probably been scolded by leftists over this past week for how dumb and useless you are. One thing I can promise you, we're not like this in real life, or at least the fun ones aren't. People that are doing work on the ground organizing will welcome you in their community with open arms if you provide a safe, productive contribution to that community. So please, I beg of you, liberals that are losing your minds because you're so scared that a fascist says one, go engage in local organizations, find if there's a DSA in your area, find if there's a food not bombs in your area, if there's a tenants union or workers union, support them, show up for them, bring your capital, bring your privilege, call up your friends, the power that country clubs and PTOs have is unheard of. Please use it. And if you have just money burning the holes in your pockets, donate to an abortion fund, donate to leftist national organizations that are trying to bring this all together.",

    "text": "What is a fascist and why is Trump one? A lot of right-wingers have told me I don't know to the definition, so here's the definition. This is from the Holocaust Memorial Fund and they describe fascism as ultra-nationalist authoritarian political philosophy. Which, in doing so, has militarism economic self-sufficiency into authoritarianism. Which we can already, at first glance, see Trump is. He self-define this as an ultra-nationalist. He has no respect for the role of law or the institutions of America. He's putting in loyalists into every single part of government. That is what authoritarians do. He himself, right, nationalist. He wanted a military parade, right? For the first time in a long time of American history, he wanted a military parade in his first term. And he has said that he wants to, like, send places back to the Stone Age. If that's not militarism, I don't know what is. Second of all, economic self-sufficiency. This whole economic plan is tariffs. Terror, sterif, sterif. We don't need to be reliant on China. We don't need our NATO allies. We don't need any people other than America. And then obviously, he opposes communism. Pluralism, his whole entire anti-DEI thing. Individual rights, like, he fundamentally doesn't respect why, like, video J has to be independent or any of those type of things, which, in guarantee, equality, democratic government, or individual rights, I mean, democratic government, he said he would be a diplomat. He said he would be a dictator on day one. But more specifically, here are some policies that they talk about. So, Shredding Exclusionary Nationalism. His focus is immigrants. If that's not exclusionary nationalism, once again, I don't know what is. Right? He is specifically saying, there is an us. We are the nation. America is the most important. And there is the them. They're trying to invade us and take over. And that leads into the second point, fixation on national decline. If you go watch, look at these characteristics and go watch his acceptance speech, where he talks about how America is falling. America is failing. America's laughed on on the national stage. And he's the only one that can fix it. That is exactly fissious to Greta-Rick, regarding national decline. And then finally, paramilitarism. God, I don't know what is paramilitarism. If January 6th is not. So yeah, at the very least, there is a very good case that he is fissistic. And anyone telling you, you don't know the definition. You just mean Trump bad. Actually, what they're doing is hearing fascism and just hearing Trump bad. What we're saying is actually, you know, he fits this very specific alt-right, far far right, authoritarian ideology that has been seen for a history. So it's very important, when we say fascism, we don't just mean Trump bad. We mean Trump bad in a very specific way.",

I just want to expand on this that there are left-leaning religions, and actually I was raised in one. I don't talk about this much on my platform because I started off-divating atheism, but I was raised in the Unitan universe list, which I was raised agnostic, it's a non-dogmatic faith, but being there surrounded me with typically left-leaning often like liberals, but still very progressive ideals and values. And the lessons and community I built and learned from there were like very foundational to how I viewed the world. And there's a lesson there that leftists need to learn, which is that the way people were raised in religion, number one, isn't their fault. And number two is quite fundamental and foundational to who they are. And so if you're not willing to work with that foundation or develop and grow off of that foundation, apart from profound personal revelation within every single person we're trying to reach, we're not going to reach people.",

The electoral strategy of leftists has always been harm reduction. It's only with the Palestinian issue being somewhat more mainstream that harm reduction per say has been the mainstream response to Democrats committing genocide. Liberals have always been the enemy.

But most importantly, I think they're so fixated on this accusation, because if you can't recognize him as a fascist, you can't attack him as a fascist. That is to say, they're robbing us of analytical tools to critique and attack and undermine Trump's power. But second of all, they're just offended. Everyone agree, fascism bad, and if suddenly we say Trump fascists look, he fits the definition, then they have to say either, oh no, actually fascism, not bad, or okay, Trump bad, but I'm okay with it. But I think the most important one is the first one. We need to be clear-headed and have the best analytical structure to understand what Trump is doing, so we can respond to what Trump is doing. And the way we respond to fascists is much, much different than how we respond to conservatives. And keep that in mind, every political action you take, think about it as an anti-fascist action.",

We saw it in America, we saw it in France, we saw it in Italy. So Dems are not the hope. But what little power we can have through them is worth having.

    "text": "Homila Harris lost because she was too far right wing. And let me explain why I think so. Take for example the two big issues that voters said they voted on, inflation and migration, both of which objectively got better under Joe Biden. They just did. But what's important is the narratives and how those narratives made the voters feel. And pretty much for the past 20 years, people have been feeling like they've been ripped off because their wage, as it compares to their productivity, has been going down, working class Americans have been hurting. And Donald Trump said, I hear you. It's because of immigration. I hear you. It's because of China. I hear you. It's because of the fed. And then naturally he took the most extremist draconian policies against these that he could. Because if you can say your wife left you and your company left you and you got fired from your job and you can't talk to your children because of immigrants, which is effectively what he did, it naturally makes sense that you could direct all that anger into a super extremist policy. And the correct response of a person with a sane mind is to say, no, your wife didn't leave you because of migration. No, your job didn't leave you because of migration. Actually, the reason you're not getting paid enough is for example, because unions have been killed over example, because companies have gained a huge amount of lobbying power. That is the left-leaning position. That is the left-leaning solution to these problems. The problems being workers feeling like they're being ripped off. But that's not what Kamala did. Kamala didn't contest that migration was an issue. She said, I'll do better on migration policy than you. Well, also wanting to convince her us that her policies would be less draconian. There is a thin line you can walk there where it's like I respect human rights more but I'm more effective at it. It's a thin line. It's much much harder to cross. Same thing with China. She didn't contest that China was an issue. She just kind of ignored it. If you look at her policy not any of her policy focused on addressing China. When once again she should have said immigration not the issue. The issue capitalist. The issue unions failing. The issue lobbying. So in short, the liberals have moved to the right. They've accepted the rights problems but offered worse solutions because they are not the right. They are not willing. The only way they can differentiate themselves on the right now is by offering worse solutions and naturally you will lose. The only way you win this is by changing the problem being addressed and then the question is which problem is more conceivable. This is what's being lost in the dichotomy of the dams can just go right right right right right right and pick up all of the left to the left of them. It doesn't work because if I if they convince me that migration is the issue. Yeah, you're going for the Republicans. The correct way to do this.",

Because they have a problem, the Republicans offer them a solution, and then the Democrats tell them that problem doesn't exist. A great example is immigration. The Democrats' solution to lowering wages compared to higher productivity used to be unions, unionized, blame the capitalists, blame the people pushing you down. Not quite enough, but that was the general narrative. They've almost completely dropped that narrative. And so now when workers come to them and say, hey guys, we're struggling. The economy's bad. They blame Trump. They say everything he did was bad, but they don't offer really concrete solutions other than subsidies here and there. Whereas Trump comes along and says, hey guys, every single one of these problems, that the Democrats are telling you aren't real, because they're saying the economy's this, but you're still in pain. So it must be the migrants. And even if immigration actually is good for them and isn't actually causing their problem, don't vote for it because it's...",

It's very little to do with Trump as a human. We would expect a populist leader like him to come along. Of course, certain things about Trump makes that better or worse, but materially, it is not just because Kamala failed. You're right.

The solution is to deny that delusion. Immigration is a scapegoat that populists use when they want to blame and justify economic strife in the working class. They say you're struggling, it's not because you're boss, it's not because of the capitalist, it's not because the people taking your money, it's because of these people. Be it whatever group of people they want to scapegoat, this case it was China and migrants. So please, I'm begging everyone, learn.

Immigration is not an issue that's the moral and arguably even liberal position right. Liberals want free open immigration more because that facilitates free trade and free market. The Liberals have conceded to what can only be called the fascist Republicans. The racist argument that immigration per se is bad.",

That is to say they trained what if it was in the Middle East would be called terrorists, but just against their political enemies. And by the way, this is not the first time or last time they've done it. No one doubts that, but I think the extent to which it's done is not appreciated by a lot of people. But they put millions and millions of dollars into doing this and actually they have an established school to do this. It's called winsec and it's used to train by and large Latin and southern American people how to become what is effectively future dictators and tools of the CIA to overthrow political enemies. So when you see America decrying terrorism and being against uprisings, sure they're the right uprisings are bad, but by and large America is doing a lot of them.",

And guys, like even if you're a megalectist, which I am, even in the communist manifesto, Marx made very, very clear. Public education and public provision of goods is fundamental to any revolutionary society or society transitioning into through socialism. And public education is destroyed when you have charter schools because it siphons money to private entities to slowly privatize education or through school vouchers, it immediately moves money from a public school to private individuals to pay a private entity, which undermines the only arguably good argument for private education, which is that it saves the tax payers money. Every other argumentation for a private school is fundamentally based on the lead-ism or classism because every student deserves the same. And so vouchers destroy the only good argument for privacy.",

And I promise you, it's really interesting and it's really insightful if you ever want to work in policy or look at policy. Especially by like the insane Republicans in power there. So first of all, Florida tried to pass a normal school voucher program where the government gives people that are going to private schools money to pay for tuition. But if I remember correctly, this was referendumed and so this was gotten rid of. And so Ron DeSanktimonius had a little idea and he copied his good friend Greg Abbott and a bunch of the good friends over at Heritage Foundation that loved to make policy really, really confusing and horrible. And he said, guys, we don't have to call it a school voucher program. Let's call it a scholarship program. And then he did one of the most confusing things ever and called it a tax credit scholarship program. The system goes like this. There are scholarship charities effectively and there are only like four or five registered with Florida that if a private individual donates up to $2,000 to them, the Floridian government will give that private individual $2,000. So just so everyone's aware, that is the same thing as the government giving these tax, these scholarship organizations money. And then the only purpose of these scholarship organizations is to give out scholarships of varying sizes, but generally not that means tested to people going to private schools. So just to run that back, instead of the government directly giving money to people who are going to private schools, which is a bad, that bad policy, right? They give money to private citizens who have given to an organization whose only purpose is to give money to people going to private schools. But they get to call it a tax credit. People love tax credits. And then they get to say they're rewarding charity. People love rewarding charity. But this charity isn't actually a charity. It's a government entity effectively. And the tax credit is just money laundering through private citizens.",

Love the condescending voice for being incorrect. There are many ways the president can protect, read productive freedoms, as an executive. To start, they could not veto a national abortion protection bill that Congress could pass, which Trump would certainly veto because he believes, as you said, it should be a state-rights issue. Second of all, they can do this pretty unilaterally, dictate abortion policy on national lands. That's a huge portion of America. They can dictate what the FDA does. So if the FDA is very, very open to make a person in the abortion bill being used, or if it's not allowed to use the abortion bill. Importantly, you said, oh, do you think they should go back to Roe v Wade? Um, yeah, they can. Amela Harris will likely be able to, if she is elected, propose three new Supreme Court justices.

    "text": "If Zionism is a movement primarily led by thinkers like Therodzo and Lensheim-Viseman to reestablish or maintain a Jewish homeland in the Levant, why are there so many Christian supporters of Zionism? This is such a good question, and there are many reasons lots and lots of Christian support Zionism, and actually it makes up the largest portion of Zionists in the world. First and foremost, anti-Semitism is a huge reason a lot of Christians support the foundation and maintenance of Israel, because there was a large movement, especially in Britain and Western Europe, to expel Jews, and giving them a homeland in Israel was at least in some people's view a good solution. This is anti-Semitism, just to be clear, and it is the reason that the one Jewish MP that was in parliament during the Balfourlake Declaration voted against it, because they viewed as an outgrowth of primarily Christian anti-Semitism. But in the modern day, there's a second and weirder reason that a lot of Christians, especially in America, support Zionism. And that is because they have a biblical and religious belief that there is no way to cause the rapture, unless all the Jews go back to Israel, and then reestablish and rebuild the temple. You heard me correctly, they believe they support this state being established, and committing horrendous acts against the Native people to cause the end of times. That by the way is still anti-Semitic, because their view is either the Jews convert or are killed in the rapture. But this is why you saw a huge outgrowth of the political Zionism from the Christian evangelical right in America. Finally, the third is not so much that they're Christian, just that they're Western, which is that Israel serves as a very good periphery state for the Western empires. So for America, for example, it serves to certify destabilization within the Middle East to establish our interests. And a lot of people at a lot of times weaponize Christian language and Christian identity to justify this imperialism. So we look at George W. Bush after 9-11 saying that he was going to do a crusade. So this doesn't have so much to do with them being Catholic or Christian, but more so, weaponizing that ideology, weaponizing that identity to justify the horrendous acts that Israel is creation and maintenance required. So I think the most helpful thing to understand is Christian Zionism is actually the primary form of Zionism. Most Zionists are Christian, and a lot of the region's Zionism was so successful has to do with either the Christian identity, weaponization of the Christian identity, or the fact that the Christian identity was prevalent within the common power group that supported the foundation of Israel.",

There's basically no chance this happens The second one is much more interesting and much less understood the national interstate combat for the popular vote You might have seen this map and if you have it, I'm gonna explain it to you So don't worry. This is all of the states that have signed on to the national interstate combat for the popular vote Which is just an agreement between states to send the electors that they send to Washington to choose the president In accordance not with their own state preference, but with who wins the national popular vote So for example if it goes into effect California if a Republican wins will send a Republican no matter what Californians voted for The current system is that if California votes Democrat which it almost always does They will send Democrat electors to Washington and whoever has the most electors will win This would only slightly change that process in changing state-by-state which electors ascend and this plays on a weird Court of the Constitution which is that who sends the electors is determined by the states not the federal government There's actually no federal mandate that they send certain electors on the basis of popular vote The only reason this isn't an effect right now is because this compact will only go into effect once they get enough electors to win the election So each state has a certain amount of electors They need enough states with enough electors that the compact controls a majority of electors and we're pretty close the yellow is proposed and the green is agreed and We're actually not that far if all of the proposed ones accepted and then we got an initiative in Florida It would happen and it should happen the electoral college is a horrible thing and Distorts the votes of American citizens. We are a democracy. We don't run by how much land you have We don't run by how wealthy you are one person one vote one equal influence on who becomes president",

If this happens, it gets sent to the House to vote for President and the Senate to vote for Vice President. And you may be thinking, hey, this is a new House, we might have a blue wave for House, and I could give Kamala a majority of House reps. But they don't vote House rep by House rep getting one vote. They vote by state delegation, which means that each state, even in the House, only gets one vote, which almost certainly means that Donald Trump wins because he has more states behind him. And then the Senate chooses Vice President, where we maybe do have a chance. And that's a really interesting question about if we have a split Senate delegation, who does that vote go to, which I don't know. But this is where we get to the weirdest part. Is the people they vote from are going to be the people with the most, the three people with the most electoral college votes, which means that if Jill Stein gets one electoral college vote, if she wins DC or something, which she won't, she could be on that ballot. She could be literally one senatorial vote away from the White House if they have to pull in progressives to choose someone for President. And that is the best chance that Jill Stein, however, actually insane she is, that she has at being President ever. It's never going to happen. But that's just to show how absolutely insane the situation would be, and it would almost certainly cause a constitutional crisis.",

Quite simply, Israel wants to be a democracy, a Jewish state with a Jewish majority, and they want the West Bank and Gaza. With those three, if they want to be a democracy, they can't have the West Bank and Gaza, because that would stop a Jewish majority. If they want the West Bank and Gaza and a Jewish majority or a Jewish state, they can't have a democracy, because there would be an Arab majority. And so their solution must be to change one of those facts. And when you happen to see them invading the West Bank now and Gaza with what just happens to be a bunch of civilian casualties, you have to ask why. With a country that has invested interest in reducing the Arab population in this area, it surely isn't a coincidence that they just so happened to be doing it.",

If this happens, it gets sent to the House to vote for President and the Senate to vote for Vice President. And you may be thinking, hey, this is a new House, we might have a blue wave for House, and I could give Kamala a majority of House reps. But they don't vote House rep by House rep getting one vote. They vote by state delegation, which means that each state, even in the House, only gets one vote, which almost certainly means that Donald Trump wins because he has more states behind him. And then the Senate chooses Vice President, where we maybe do have a chance. And that's a really interesting question about if we have a split Senate delegation, who does that vote go to, which I don't know. But this is where we get to the weirdest part. Is the people they vote from are going to be the people with the most, the three people with the most electoral college votes, which means that if Jill Stein gets one electoral college vote, if she wins DC or something, which she won't, she could be on that ballot. She could be literally one senatorial vote away from the White House if they have to pull in progressives to choose someone for President. And that is the best chance that Jill Stein, however, actually insane she is, that she has at being President ever. It's never going to happen. But that's just to show how absolutely insane the situation would be, and it would almost certainly cause a constitutional crisis.",

    "text": "So why do leftist hate liberals? I think even a lot of leftists don't understand this. So quite simply leftist hate liberals because liberals enable a comedy and allow for the material conditions, as well as the actual reality that creates fascists. As well as liberals just being wrong, like in their political and economic analysis, even if just what you care about is like gay people good and like social facts, we all agree fascists are bad, liberals enable and often align themselves with fascists We could go through historical examples where for example, Britain and America funded a Nazi sympathizer to overthrow the Shah, or when they literally committed genocide in Korea. Ultimately, what liberals care about is maintaining the capitalist economic system, even if that comes at cost of any social goods that they purport to care about. And sometimes that will be them doing the horrible things, and sometimes that will be them funding fascists who openly loudly do the horrible things. This is arguably what they did in Israel. To put quite simply, the Cold War was between America and communists. And if those are seen as two binary sides of a coin, you have to ask yourself ideologically what's the opposite of communism? And then when you look through the history, it makes a whole lot of sense, which side America tend to find itself on. So we don't just hate liberals because like we are more moral than them, or like we're more correct historically than them. We hate liberals because they are enabling fascists and oftentimes actively work with them. So even if you want to say liberals, when they are in power, currently are a little bit better to the vast majority of minority groups, the material conditions that they support, and often they're foreign aims align immediately with fascists, and at least more of fascists than it does with the very people that they report to protect.",

Iran's first elected Prime Minister was ousted in favor of an autocratic Shah that would maintain British-Agemony of Owoyle in Iran by American and British military. And then as a natural response to an autocratic western Shah being put in place, the Iranian people reacted with an unstable revolution that was the Iranian revolution, which put in place the IRGC. I don't like the IRGC and I wish they were not in control of Iran. But whenever you point to Iran for how, oh my god, that whole entire region of the world, they're just so, you know, regressive and revolting and then somehow the next step is, guys, we should bomb them. You have to remember, the reason they are regressive, the reason they are the where they are rather than democratically elected and probably quite progressive and leftist is because we bombed them to smithereens. And specifically for Iran, intervenes in their elected democracy.",

If I was doing this to be disingenuous, I would be disingenuous where it benefits me. But also, like what I said was that Kamala's best subscribed to the liberal and Trump is best subscribed to the fascist, and I hate them both for the both of those reasons, and I articulated the reasons I hated them. And then all my responses were a bunch of people downplaying the harms of liberalism and forgetting that liberals did most of the atrocities in like the modern world.

    "text": "There is no distinction between the political and economic. If you're saying fascism and neoliberalism are necessarily not mutually exclusive, because one is political and one is economic and therefore they can coexist, you're missing the fact that the economic policies are political. And actually, the concept that economics is not political is a primarily neoliberal, at least Western concept. When John Adams was writing, like some of the foundational work for economic liberalism, he considered himself to be engaging in political philosophy. And only after that was it labeled expos facto to be supremely economic. And if you read it, it reads as political philosophy, because the economic is the political. So I agree, you could in some extraordinarily strange way be both truly a liberal and truly a fascist. But in the same way, you could be truly a liberal and truly conservative. In this sense, we are talking about two separate ideas that possibly can coexist.",

The Lehi specifically were the most extremist of them, but the Haganah, the one that people tend to say is the more reputable, acceptable one, actively covered for the Lehi and Irugun in those massacres.

Why don't I just do what I can to fight against them the most? To that, I'd say understanding them, distinguishing liberalism and its causes of fascism and the effects of fascism and the underlying ideologies of fascism is the first step to understanding them and then is the first step to deconstructing them, which is what you must do to beat them. And so like, I'm online, I'm talking online. All I can do is try and get people to understand things so that they have more tools to when they encounter them in their real life or when they encounter them in discussions, have the tools to deconstruct and beat these bad ideologies. And so me trying to articulately and clearly describe what these ideologies are, their flaws, their harms, it gives y'all the tools to address and respond to them. So it's not a primary goal, but it's a secondary goal because we all hate liberalism and fascism. We need to understand them to beat them.",

Is yes, Kamaheras has been taking actions that are accommodating fascism. But when I'm saying he's at her core, her ideology, and fundamentally her policies and approach to things still follow the neoliberal tradition. Let's just respond to the claim. Genocide is not uniquely fascist. Actually, I would argue that a lot of genocides are a direct result of an outgrowth of the neoliberal concept of a nation state. So they happen because neoliberal's value the nation state and give them sovereignty in order to establish a nation state you need a nation of a common peoples, which causes genocides and ethnic cleansing. That's how liberalism causes this. Fascism does it differently. The expansion of the police state and a cop city does seem to be them accommodating and incorporating fissionistic policies, but their rhetoric regarding it is fundamentally different than that which a fascist authoritarian right-wing person would say. I don't like Biden. I don't like Kamah. I don't like Trump.",

And I vehemently hate Donald Trump because he is a fascist. But when we call them both fascists, when we are unable to distinguish what the two people are doing, right?

That's why Jill Steinbott's are like infuriating to talk with, is because they're not engaged with reality. So I'm just going to pause it. The correct analysis is that Kamala Harris is a neoliberal maintaining the neoliberal tradition of the American Empire and is accommodating the neoliberal agenda to the fascist pushes. Very similar to neoliberals in the past. Whereas Donald Trump is the populist fascist push throughout that we've seen throughout history that is coming in with overly clearly fascistic policies that really don't resemble the neoliberal policies at all and come to odds with them, for example, with open trade with other countries. And both are very bad. And it is true that Kamala Harris is enabling the fascist pull. That's true. But when we're unable to distinguish the two, we're unable to say anything valuable about either.

It's a fun exercise every time that a Jill Stein Bought comes into your comments saying, Foo, Jill Stein, JoJo, you're horrible. Ask them what another third party is. Because there are other third parties. There's the Working Families Party for example in America who actually are running a lot of candidates in local elections and actually building grassroots organizing places and not just coming around every four years asking for your money. So yeah, I agree America needs a third party, but the way America is set up right now if you want to do that through electoral democracy It will not happen top down. It will happen bottom up. That's just how it's set up. That's like a true fact about the system I'm so sorry no amount of Jill Stein whining will change that we can talk about whether electoral politics good Electoral politics bad electoral politics effective electoral politics not effective. She's engaged in electoral politics She doesn't get out of the system just because she's losing so seriously. Yes, I agree Jill Stein's not going to give you that pin",

Palestinians can move there, Israelis can move there, anything's fine. First off, not even the Oslo Accords, which were a massive secession by the Palestinian people, agree with you. Actually, it recognizes that as land that Palestinian authorities should eventually come to have sovereignty over, and that they should slowly transfer to Palestinian control. Second of all, the Oslo Accords bound Israel to not increase settlement within Aresy even. So you're just wrong what set up the system area, area A, B and C in the West Bank, disagrees with you. Well, let's take you right you word. If it is Israeli territory, then everyone in that territory that has lived there for, I don't know, a generation or two has lived in that territory, didn't move as immigrants, they should be citizens. When the Oslo Accords were agreed on, did Israel give the Palestinians living their citizenship? No. So it's not Israeli land.",

You realize that would mean that the PA would be justified in striking civilian places in Israel, right? Because even according to America, the biggest cuck for Israel, West Bank settlers have been committing terrorism against Palestinians and Israel has not properly held them to account. Does that justify the PA striking Tel Aviv? No, of course not. Even if the PA was as evil as Israel, which they're not. It would still clearly not justify a sovereign nation's civilian territory being striked.",

And in attempting to, she will have lied to the public and utilized and leveraged a literal genocide to enable that lie. Like seriously sit and think about what I'm accusing Jill Stein of. I am suggesting that she actually does not want to win the presidency, actually doesn't want to gain political power in this election cycle. She wants 5% for federal funding for her party, which is a good thing. But in doing so, she has leveraged the Gaza genocide by saying she is the solution to that and completely misled the American public. Really, maybe not misled, but consistently lied to them about her intentions. And more of the grandstandard, thousands of people, when she is being immoral. So once again, if you vote for Jill Stein because you want her to get the 5%, that's fine. It doesn't mean you have to think she's a good person, and she certainly isn't the peak of morality that she shows herself to be.",

First of all, you don't mean the PLO you mean the PA the PA is the administrative body that runs area C of the West Bank and then has some domestic control in area B or they would if Israel actually respected the Oslo Accords but they're clearly not given that they have just bombed the West Bank the largest strike in quite a while just yesterday. Even on paper if you are an area C which is administered by Israel not the PA you do not have the right to Israeli citizenship despite you being administered by these rallies. So if you're in Israeli you have the right to move into area C in the settlements right but if you are a Palestinian you don't have the right to live in Israel that's apartheid.",

And it's also plain, obvious, and simple. They have troops there. They've moved civilians in there. They claim jurisdiction under their domestic law in that area. Whether you think it's illegally occupied is a different question. Whether you think they're claimed to it is valid. That's a different question. But it's by definition occupied. So you can play the game of everyone that ever says anything against you is just biased and that's all they're ever doing. Even though the UN is the body that created Israel. Or you could take an honest and real look at international law and what it says the definition of occupation is and come to like the extraordinarily reasonable conclusion that very few reasonable people can test.

If you want to feel like everyone's attacking you and hating you for no reason, fine. But actually take two seconds to reflect on how you engage in arguments like you did pretend in this video and maybe you'll see why people find you like wildly annoying to engage with. You're right.

Boy are y'all in for a story, because I was watching this video expecting it to be normal misinformation about g-transitioners, but then we got the twist. This far right wing conservative organization of the epic times has a story, because it's not your typical spreader of conspiracy theories about QAnon and anti-vaccine stuff. What's interesting about it is that it's affiliated with Fallen Gong, a new religious movement, and I hear you, what's Fallen Gong? Why does a new religious movement that was originally based in China have anything to do with detransitioners? Well, well, well, this is where the plot thickens. Have you ever seen this poster and sometimes it'll say China before communism under it? This is also run by Fallen Gong. So, a little context. Fallen Gong is a religious organization that was massively prosecuted under the CCP regime, which horrendous things were done to it under the CCP regime. But in response, they have gone on a massive propaganda campaign against the CCP. And Shen Yun is one of their first ways they did it. They went on a world tour of a play and show against the Chinese government, fair enough. But then they got a little smart. They realized that their best allies against the CCP were going to be American conservatives. So they founded the Epic Times. So they got into the business of duping conservative Americans. And what dupes conservative Americans, the absolute best, fear tactics on culture wars and conspiracy theories. And boy, have they done a good job, and boy, have TikTok conservatives got in duped. That source that Kim sided there at the Epic Times talking about detransitioners and the horrors of detransitioning and childhood gender affirming care is literally anti-CCP propaganda. It is religious propaganda with explicitly political ends. So I don't think there's much more to do other than just pointed laugh at someone literally citing active propaganda. And then if he says anything ever about fair media, Fox News is like the most neutral source compared to Fallen Gong, which explicitly has a play actively degrading the CCP. And explicitly supports human on theories. But what little more there is to say can actually engage with the lies of that propaganda. And I remind you, it doesn't have to be lies to be propaganda. It being politically motivated and religiously motivated by a different religion than he is makes it propaganda in and of itself. But as to the substance, right, this is the meta-analysis looking over gender affirming surgery. It's basically most of the data we get in it finds within 27 studies. It pulled 8,000 transgender patients and it found a gender affirming surgery regret under 1%. So use real data, not prop.",

But if you don't have to disclose money coming even from within your own country for a candidate that's like very public about their money, that is so much worse. That means the actual candidate that you are electing and their campaign is engaging in this exact type of corruption. I would much rather trust that Russia once a corrupt and reviled American election, then I would rather trust like the campaign or candidate engaging with it, right? Like that's why Trump's collusion with Russia was an issue. We would expect Russia to collude. We wouldn't expect a candidate to reinmit it. And also just be clear, America consistently interferes with almost every other country's elections that we care about. This demonization of a country colluding to inner fear with an election is so hypocritical coming from America. It's bad, but it's hypocritical.",

Guys, we already tax similar types of taxes property tax is a type of unrealized capital gains tax They're a least we go out and evaluate property and we say it's worth this much So it's gonna be taxed this much exactly like you would do to stocks or you would do to any other type of asset You already have to report to the IRS for example depreciating assets It's possible don't let anyone fool you into saying this is really really complicated because especially for the people This is affecting they're gonna be able to spend millions and millions of dollars on tax accountants to try and avoid and minimize the Conflicated situation anyway.

You would imagine that if they were so ubiquitously hated and there were so many of them, there would be somehow more hate crimes against them. But the truth of the matter is there isn't because it isn't a hated group in America. Christians are the dominant social influence of America. So most of the hate that you see directed against them is just a reaction to hate that originated from Christians. That's a reminder when we're statistically the most hateful group is, which is white Christian nationalists. They commit the most acts of domestic terror, yearly, year in and year out.

    "text": "Well often lumped together, gay men and lesbians have less in common than one might think. I get it's a joke, but I will take this moment and any other conceivable moment to spread this fun fact. So here is some queer history from y'all. And why I will never ever ever hate on lesbians, because I love them dearly. Did you know the L in LGBT was moved to the front for a reason. It's not random, it's not because it flows off the tongue better. It was an active move, right? Especially around the 80s and 90s to honor and represent lesbians within the community. And there had been a push for it before, because lesbians often got ignored, because there were gay bars and not lesbian bars, the gay rights movement center around gay men, etc. But the reason it gained popularity and the reason that it got pushed finally was because of the AIDS epidemic. And because lesbians were some of the few people that would treat gay men, and were huge, consistent allies advocating against the horrendous treatment that gay men got under that time, under the government, under huge amount of institutions, the stigma and the hate that they got. And so we moved the L in front as an honor and recognition to make sure they never were left out of our community. They were a part of our community and recognized for the service and care that they had given everyone in the community. And it may not seem as relevant now. It may just seem like a nice thing, a symbolic thing. But I do want to remind you that there are people today trying to change this acronym. And there are two groups of people doing it. One of them is trying to make it more inclusive, add an A or an I or a plus. And that's fantastic. But the other group is trying to take away a T. And this is a good moment to recognize that these acronyms matter. They represent things and there's a reason they're trying to take it. It's not silly. It's not just alphabet soup. We use this to represent who we care about, who we respect, who we dignify. And who we're working for. And the liberation of trans people has always been part of this movement. We'll always be part of this movement and we'll never stop being part of this movement. And just like we move the L in front to dignify and recognize them, we will maintain the T there because they are part of this movement and they are just as important.",

You see all these private corporations that own a huge portion of the world's oil production? Most of them are either American or British. And I think among the leftist circles, it's often appreciated that a lot of the foreign wars America gets into are because of oil. But it's not often appreciated that the reason we're going isn't just to secure oil to like us or to our allies. It is also to maintain control of the oil supply. It is to monopolize. It is to get rid of competitors. Us invading there to establish capitalism and democracy is literally monopolizing our greatest resource. It is literally counter capitalistic. Just thought I'd make that point that the reason we're doing huge amounts of government intervention isn't just like not capitalistic for that reason. It's also not capitalistic because it's literally trying to monopolize oil production within the hands of the American hegemony.",

I've seen way too many of these videos watching RC just absolutely ran into the point, and picking on easy targets for no reason. And what point you may ask? The point is that we are suggesting that people are erasing women from history, and then RC responds by erasing the women contribution from history. Like, notice how we only responded to three, and then when he responds, he failed to mention the obvious contribution that that woman actually did have. So while I agree they're an easy target, they're stating things that are slightly true, unclear, unprecise. RC is being overly pedantic, and obviously missing the point. So let's try and make this a little harder for him. RC, who invented the disposal diaper? Or the appgar method, which is the test that they use to make sure that your baby is healthy and doing okay. That seems important. Or the inventor of Kevlar, you know the thing that is used in bulletproof vests? Be as pedantic as you want. There are many contributors to all of these things, and when we're talking about these things, we're talking about all of the contributions and highlighting women's contributions, because of people like you that will take any conceivable opportunity to ignore women's contributions to them. And when you respond and cut around the obvious and clear contributions, to make a pedantic point about how a man also contributed, or a man was the final beneficiary, you're proving the point that there are people that actively work to erase women from history, precisely like you're doing.",

Because first of all, our point is not that it will end abortion. Our point is that it will work better than what you're suggesting, which is making it legal, which is actually what most of the data suggests. But secondarily, the reason we bring it up is not just because we think it's more effective than your solution. The reason we bring it up is because a lot of you don't agree with it. So it's to point out the obvious hypocrisy of being against abortion, but also against contraceptives. And I'm not suggesting that that's you, so refer to point one, but two, you're talking to all pro-lifers, and you have to recognize that a huge amount of pro-lifers are also evangelical Christian conservatives who are working actively to reduce access to contraceptives, reduce access to sex education in schools, and reduce federal funding for contraceptives. So that's why we bring up this point, because that's obviously hypocritical, because they're not actually reducing abortion. And finally, we're not just saying contraceptives will end it. We're advocating a whole suite of policies. But while you typically make really good arguments, this was a flagrant misrepresentation of what we're saying, and I don't understand why you would make it.

Because the source you cited literally says that almost a third of those lesbians women reported only male perpetrators. But let's look at literally what you screened shot at, which is 44% of lesbians, 61% of bisexual women. What do you think maybe the variable between lesbians and bisexual women are? More men. I hate to go back to the actual science that you cited, but that's exactly what we see. 90% of bisexual women reported only male perpetrators. The source you cited said this multiple times and noted the precise difficulty with such crimes. So why are you citing a source that number one proves precisely what we're saying, and number two does not support you in any way form or fashion. Of course women also perpetrate, we are saying that they are much much less likely to. And that's what the data you show says.",

Because yeah, lots of Christians and Christian historians or Christian centric historians have used that terminology, but the current consensus with an academia is generally to use B.C.E. before common era. Specifically to distance academia from a lot of Christianity that was built into original academia because of how problematic it becomes to mix religion and academia. And because claims regarding Christ's existence and the specific timeline in which Christ exists are subjects of academia and not preconceptions of academia. So like no, no, the fact that people use certain words doesn't prove your proposition, it just proves that people agree with you and have infected the language that we use with that. And then intelligently, that's not the social norm anymore. B.C.E. before common era love.",

And I can look at them and say wow I'm not attracted to them. I don't have to have sex with them. Of course sexuality is based on attraction. Virgins have sexuality, right? And people that have never had inner course with both genders have sexuality. I'm gay, never had an inner course with a woman. Very clear that I'm not attracted to them. The difficulty here is what if due to that inner attraction you can't have inner course with them. Then can I just never know that I'm not straight?",

Yeah, we don't want the wealthy running us, but surely you're a Trump supporter. That's not what you're saying. What do you say about Trump? What about Donald Trump? Well guess what? Donald Trump doesn't use tax money in order to afford things like this. He's a businessman. What a fascinating claim. Because I would love to know where Trump gets this money. But he, unlike Kamala Harris, hasn't released his tax returns. And when we did start looking into how Trump made his money, didn't it turn out so well for him? Did it? Let's also adjust the claim that Kamala is spending tax pair money for this. This is her income just on taxpayer money, and this is her endogues income. Do you see the difference there? How maybe the vast majority of money that she's getting is from the extraordinarily wealthy and successful private attorney that she's married to? And then the subsequent investments that they make jointly. And surely the taxpayer money she is spending on it is less than the fraudulent money.",

    "text": "Did gymnastics that makes people short or short people that go into gymnastics? So happy you asked this question. Thank you. What I'll start with is the myth, which is that when you do tumbling or when you do vault, compresses your spine and therefore you get a little shorter. And then after you quit gymnastics, you get a little taller, which is what I experienced. I don't know if that's true though. Hank Green, please please please please, stitch and tell me. But what I will tell you is that doing gymnastics as a tall person has to be logistically very, very difficult. And here's one clear easy example. These are the parallel bars and a lot of the skills are above the bar and that you can be as tall for whatever. But some of the skills are below the bar and you have to swing under them and you get points off for bending your knees or hunching over or something if you swing under them and don't want to hit the ground. And if you're taller, that's less space to do less things, right? But if you're short, you can do a lot more. You have a lot more ability to look graceful and not bend your knees doing it and you get those points. Logistically, being short attends to put you at a more central center of gravity and a lower center of gravity. So in my experience, it's made tumbling easier and also a massing larger upper body strength easier because it's not a spread out, which is super necessary for things like high bar or pommel horse. Less to control and less to build muscle on so you can have more control over what you have. There's basically nothing that being taller would help you on. It might help you tumble longer. I don't know. But there's also only so big that the floor is. And so if you're longer in tumbling, you take up more of the space and then you might go out of balance more. Basically, the answer is it's certainly short people going into gymnastics or saying into gymnastics longer. But there might also be a making shorter people. I don't really know. But I can tell you that it's definitely very difficult to be a talker.",

So here's the most basic conceivable case for the fact that Israel is in a part of that state. This is the West Bank. Sovereign, Palestinian, territory. Also, sovereign, Palestinian, territory, Gaza. And just as a brief recap of international law, if Israel occupies other people's sovereign territory, they are considered an occupying body, militarily, and an international law. And when you are an occupying body, you are responsible for ensuring equal rights of the people that you are occupying. Which means that if it is true that Israel occupies the West Bank, the West Bank civilians, the Palestinian civilians, are entitled to equal rights as Israeli civilians. And this is the current political makeup of the West Bank. So the kind of like yellow is the Palestinian control, blue is Israeli control, and then there are little bits in between. But for keeping this as basic as conceivably possible, let's talk about the blue bits, which are called area C, and constitute 60% of the West Bank. This is the place, if you hear illegal settlements, this is primarily what they're talking about, which is in area C of the West Bank. Israel is moving Israeli civilians into this area, specifically to maintain Israeli control of that territory. And under an underdomestic Israeli law, civilians of Israel, if you live in Tel Aviv, you can move into this area. But here's the catch. If you are a Palestinian resident of this area, and you only hold a Palestinian ID card, you cannot move to Tel Aviv, for example. Which means that if we consider all of Israel, and then also area C, specifically, as territory controlled by Israel. So Israel and occupied territories of Israel, that means that there are civilians who have the freedom of movement between them, and there are civilians that don't. Palestinians, civilians, do not have freedom of movement. Israeli civilians do. That is the most basic conceivable explanation for one of the most clear obvious evident, un-rivical examples of how Israel is under apartheid state. It is a ghettoization of certain sovereign territories, specifically to segregate and maintain ethnic control of certain territories. That is a perfect.",

She was a trained activist, which is not diminishing at all what she did. Like, lots and lots of cases are like this. They're specifically put in the situation where they specifically choose to do the specific things they do because they want to make a legal case to challenge a long-held doctrine that they sell you or some other activist group thinks they could challenge. And that's precisely what Rosa Parks did in this case. She was an activist because she thought at that time the case was winnable and she was right and ended up returning a massive long doctrine. And just for educational purposes, this is extraordinarily common. A lot of those large cases, or even small civil rights wins, you either go out and find a claimant and you're lucky enough to find a claimant that has a good case that you can actually go take. Or you go find someone who could be a claimant and try and get them in a situation where they have a claim or do a preeminent case. This is precisely what that case on making gay website weddings was for. So yeah, love Rosa.",

This is unequivocally a win for the progressive move and should be celebrated as such. Josh Shapiro, the other option, was unequivocally more moderate, more rightist, and not nearly as progressive as Tim Walls.

Yes, but it is unequivocally true that this is due to the progressive activists and parickas of workers that yelled and yet screamed at Kamala to not pick a staunch, staunch moderate and rightist as her VP pick.

Josh Shapiro is the wrong answer. If Kamala picks Josh Shapiro, she will be taking almost any and all progressive wind out of her campaign sales, which she is appealing to Gen Z right now. Josh Shapiro referred to people my age in college as members of the KKK. Tim Walls on the other hand has passed some of the most progressive policies in Minnesota's history. Neither are good. Both the Liberals, both support what's going on in Israel. But my God is there a wrong option. And it's been decided we're still waiting to know but guys come on. We need an attribution.",

Because apparently he didn't know. What we mean is that there are policies similar to a partite in South Africa, which there are. Citizenship is excluded on the basis of being Arab, because Jews have a fast track and a specific claim to citizenship that Arabs do not. And Arabs have been consistently systematically denied their citizenship following the Nakhva, because they're Arab. Separate roads, schools, neighborhoods, territories, rights for Jews and Palestinians. That looks a lot like a partite. And human rights organizations within Israel agree. This isn't an external American perspective, it's both an internal and international perspective. So Noah, it's not just random American students calling you out for human rights abuses. You are lying to everyone's faces consistently.",

Pregnant people is more precise. Even if you want to be transphobic, that is still incorrect and less precise. Servicates are not mothers. People with ectopic pregnancies. Not mothers.

But you are also promoting an anti-Semitic trope and we need to stop most Zionists in America and across the world are Christian. And a lot of the support for Zionism comes from anti-Semitism.

Or at least the things that are shown on it never existed at the same time. So come with me while I find the date that this globe is made. It turns out really, really interestingly at the very end. First we start with the fact that China does not have to bet yet, which means that this is before 1949. And then right next to it, we see that India has not been partitioned yet, meaning that this is before 1947. Moving forward, we see that Iran is not called Persia at this time. So this means that it is after 1935 when they changed their name. So those things put this pretty strongly, either during or on the precipice of World War II. So in order to find out the exact time during this time period, we have to look at Europe and what events have happened and what haven't. First we can note that Austria has been invaded by Germany, which means that this is after March 12, 1938 when Germany invaded. But Poland is still shown as independent and not part of German control, meaning that this is before 1939, October, when Germany invaded and took control of Poland. And I would have stopped there, had someone not pointed out, the thing that actually makes this globe not possible, which is the fact that the second Vienna awards have happened, which we can note that North Transylvania has been awarded to Hungary and not Romania, meaning that this has to be after 1940, August 30th, conflicting with the fact that they still see Poland as independent. The best explanation we can think of for this is that this was likely made in America, where we did not recognize German control of Poland, but we would recognize something like the second Vienna awards, which was an agreed upon treaty. So that pretty solidly places it in 1940. Thank you so much for watching.",

    "text": "abortion is not on the ballot in 2024 forever. It absolutely is, Cam, but let's see what twisted constitutional logic he uses to justify this flagrantly wrong statement. President of the United States or Congress do not possess the legal authority to legislate abortion. The 10th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution is very clear. The powers of the... Great, so we're talking about the 10th Amendment. Which for reference is this. But importantly, it gives all the powers to either the states or the people. That's important. All Cam seems to be claiming that none of the powers granted to the executive office of the federal government or the Congress have anything at all to do with abortion. Which is wrong. For example, they regulate the abortion laws in DC. That's a clear obvious counter-example, Cam. In DC, the abortion laws are regulated by the Congress. You are just flagrantly wrong. Or on federal lands. They also regulate on federal lands the allowance of abortion clinics. The federal government and the Office of President and Congress have jurisdiction in these specific areas on abortion. They also have specific rights to regulate interstate commerce, which they have snuck an extraordinary amount of legislation through. Of which they could regulate the transmission of abortion-related drugs or not. Which I promise you, Donald Trump, will do. As Republicans who are actively supporting Donald Trump are already litigating on the already existed federal protections on abortion through regulation of the FDA. So I ask you, Cam. Do you think the FDA is violating the Constitution by regulating Mifopristone? Which is the abortion pill? And so they are regulating abortion? No, of course not. Because the FDA has jurisdiction across the states to regulate things like that. So there are obvious obvious examples. There are interesting ways you can use federal powers to regulate abortion. And then there are wider catch-all phrases like the Necessarian Proper Clause in the Constitution, which has been used consistently to sneak a lot of legislation into this. All of which are tools that a president or a Congress that is intent on restricting the right of abortion or is intent on giving it all to the states will use to strip all federal protections we have of abortion already. And a person that you vote in Congress or you vote in this coming November has the choice to either use those tools to protect your fundamental right to abortion or strip federal protections of it. Do not let them convince you on bootleg constitutional analysis that it is powerless. No, the president has the power, for example, to put three horrendously bad Supreme Court members into the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. Of course the presidency matters to abortion. Of course Congress who affirms the Supreme Court matters to abortion. That's how Donald Trump got abortion, protections, gotten rid of in the first place. This is an insane thing to say about Donald Trump who is possibly one of the most effective presidents on abortion policy ever. Of course the presidency and of course Congress impacted abortion policy. And of course that's what we're voting on right now.",

Noah, if you disagree with the Supreme leaders take on human rights, which I know I do, you should urge the government that paid you to turn in their leaders, because they were just found to have consistently, institutionally and systemically violated human rights. The government that you have represented have consistently accused the arbiters and enforcers of the Western institutions of human rights, of existing only to suppress your government. So actually, you would believe that the foundations of the Western human rights regime are flawed. Being against human rights isn't just despicable when it's people you don't like doing it, Noah. It's also despicable when you do it, and you just happen to get a shit ton more Western funding to do it.",

And equivalently, what I say in public has a different motive and goal than what I write down in a voting booth. Let's try and clear that up a bit. When I advocate against the Democrats, because I think they're supporting a G side in Gaza, I'm doing that because I want to put pressure on the Democrats as much as is conceivably possible to push them to change that policy.

They got that equipment. What specific organization? Palestinian Authority. That's okay. So not Hamas.

    "text": "Combined the date this clue was made with me and why I found the date and then it turned out being wrong. So we can first start in modern day Yemen, which is currently called the Federation of South Arabia, which only existed between 1962 and November 30th, 1967. But it's important to note here that the land that is being called Federation of South Arabia is actually all of South Yemen, which should cause some problems later. But tell then we can move to Singapore and know that it is separate from Malaysia at this time, so that means that this is after 1965 when it was separated. Next we can see that the former British Guiana has gained independence as Guiana, meaning that this is after May 26th, 1966. And moving up just a little bit, Barbados has also gained independence, meaning it's after November 30th, 1966. And finally to put us in a solid eight month range, we can look at French Somaliland, which has not yet been renamed to a farce in the sauce, meaning that this is before July 3rd, 1967. Would place us between November 30th, 1966 and July 3rd, 1967. But as all things are, this doesn't seem quite to be perfect. And as I was looking over Africa, there seems to be a problem. Because this map must be from after 1968, because Spanish Guinea has been renamed to Equatorial Guinea. What this means is that the Glomaker just failed to update the name of the Federation of South Arabia and of French Somaliland. So if this is after 1968, we can look at Oman, Cambodia, and the naming of Port Arthur in Canada to prove that this is at least before 1970. Seeing us definitively between 1968 and 1970. If you have a globe you want me to date, then please DM me or happily make a video of it. If you like this type of stuff, follow me. I make a bunch of it. Thank you.",

My favorite thing about college campuses, like doing things, is that it makes no itch pee. A grown adult who's paid to do this work, have to come after kids, have to come after like 18, 19, and 20 year old, for their political beliefs. And she does that as a job. Like she goes around and interviews people, asking them to just say that like 18 year old is a dumb, shock and horror. Are 18 year olds dumb? Oh my goodness, this is groundbreaking political analysis. No, like damn. But yeah, like get a job, Noah. Like do work. Contribute to society. Don't just say you're interviewing people, ask them to call like 18, 19, and 20 year olds dumb.",

    "text": "Let's date this globe. This type of globe in this time period is incredibly hard to get specific, but I found some interesting things and got as close as I think one possibly can on this globe. And if you see new things that I didn't, please tell me. First, we're going to start in Namibia, because we see that it is currently occupied by South Africa and Wallace Bay is still owned by South Africa, which means that it is after 1968 because it's called Namibia, but it's still occupied, which means that it's before 1990 and certainly before 1993, due to Wallace Bay. Now we're going to move over to Germany, which is currently still split between the Federal Republic and the German Democratic Republic, meaning that this is prior to 1989. Then we move slightly south over to Western Sahara, where kindly enough, this globe notes that Western Sahara has been occupied by Morocco, which means that this is after 1975. Then moving further south, we see that Zimbabwe is not called Zimbabwe Rhodesia, as it was known prior to 1980, so that means that this globe is after 1980, which places us pretty squarely in the 80s, which I have found to be one of the most difficult decades to date. But we can move up and note that Burkina Faso is not called Upper Volta, which means that this is after 1984. That puts us in a five-year range, but I know we can do slightly better. So I actually found out that prior to 1987, Frabascher Bay was called Frabascher Bay, but it has since been renamed a Collowit, which means that this globe was made between 1984 and 1987. If you all know of some event that could get it more precise, please, please tell me, and if you like these videos, please like it, please follow me, because I have so many more that I want to do. Thank you all so much.",

It's an interview that she does with four family members of hostages, and talks about how horrible and disgusting etc it is. But then at the end she asks about the political issue, should we have a cease fire? Basically they say that should be up to the hostages. Let's look at what they are saying as a forum. They're actually immediately calling for the Israeli government to do, is to return to the negotiation table. Because what they're actually calling for is for Israel to return to the negotiating table, because they want a negotiated deal to get their family members out of Gaza as quickly as possible. It has been Nya Nyaahu and his extremists that they have been blaming on delaying this hostage exchange. And if you look quoted, it's Nya Nyaahu that has said the secondary political goal of destroying Hamas. So great Noah, have the hostages families talk. But tell us what they actually are calling for the government that you have represented to do.",

    "text": "I did find out that this globe that my grandpa left me was even more interesting than I thought, because it is actually not possible. Or at least the things that are shown on it never existed at the same time. So come with me while I find the date that this globe is made. It turns out really, really interestingly at the very end. First we start with the fact that China does not have to bet yet, which means that this is before 1949. And then right next to it we see that India has not been partitioned yet, meaning that this is before 1947. Moving forward we see that Iran is not called Persia at this time, so this means that it is after 1935 when they changed their name. So those things put this pretty strongly either during or on the precipice of World War II. So in order to find out the exact time during this time period we have to look at Europe and what events have happened and what haven't. First we can note that Austria has been invaded by Germany, which means that this is after March 12, 1938 when Germany invaded. But Poland is still shown as independent and not part of German control, meaning that this is before 1939, October, when Germany invaded and took control of Poland. And I would have stopped there, had someone not pointed out, the thing that actually makes this globe not possible, which is the fact that the second Vienna awards have happened, which we can note that North Transylvania has been awarded to Hungary and not Romania, meaning that this has to be after 1940, August 30th. Conflicting with the fact that they still see Poland as independent. The best explanation we can think of for this is that this was likely made in America, where we did not recognize German control of Poland, but we would recognize something like the second Vienna awards, which was an agreed upon treaty. So that pretty solidly places it in 1940. Thank you so much for watching.",

It's because the Biden-Harris campaign is going to need to fundamentally change their campaign following this. They are not going to be able to rely on demonizing Trump and attacking Trump unilaterally. The right is already pulling this victimized BS, but they are right. It's going to come off a lot less appealing to voters and to pretty much everyone to say that Trump and his people are the utter worst people in the world, horrible disgusting destroying America. When it was under Biden that one of the first in a few decades, um, attempted assassination attempts happened. And that it was against a political rival. His accusations of attacking a political rival are going to get so much stronger to people who might already be a little bit susceptible to it. Trump being the victim is dangerous and we need to work hard against it. The victim of today are the two people that died, not the fascists that got scratched.",

First and foremost, instead of Manchuria, we see Manchuko, which is a puppet state of Manchuria owned by Japan during the time of 1932 and 1945. Then we see that British Somali land still exists, which was taken over by the Italians in 1940. And this last one kind of gives it away. We see Germany not having Poland, which means that it is prior to 1939, September 1st, but it does have Austria, meaning it's March 12th. It also has half of Slovakia. So this ultimately narrows it down to the year and a few month period between March 12th, 1938 and September 1st, 1939. Yeah, so that's my old-ass globe. I have like three other globes, and I'm happy and enjoy doing this. So, if you want to see it, I know it's different, but let me know, and I'm happy to show you the rest of them.

More trust was trying to be developed, etc. So just working towards the ability. Wouldn't that be in the interest of Israel as far as, you know, they're more trustworthy of their mobile and then they could slowly, slowly, you know, decrease their, their occupation and just work towards a trust is. Ensemble the very violent and but if there was another group with stronger, stronger leadership, that was more moderate and more stable. Well, that was the PLO in the 1970s. Like that, that's what they were. They were moderate and they had a huge support from the Palestinians. Israel still attacked them. The issue is Israel doesn't want that. If you take them out, they're word right. Israel wants one state solution. Netanyahu has said that he wants a greater Israel. That includes actually the Sinai, includes parts of Syria, includes parts of Lebanon. Right. He wants a greater Israel. He wants a one state solution. He's not. When they talk about this, they talk in language of we just what piece we it's only home, I'll splank like a bike. But then once they're away from that, once they're talking to Israelis, they make it pretty clear. For the past 10, 15 years, the far right government of Israel has wanted a one state solution.",

    "text": "I found the wrong date of this globe the first time, so let's go back and find the actual right answer. So the first thing, as a lot of people pointed out, is Germany has its newer borders with Poland and does not have East Prussia, which means that this is after 1945, which would be post-World War II. I was really in awe at how specific y'all got with this, but I think I hit the World War II crowd. So I got a lot of people noting that Kunisberg is now called Kullingdraut, which happened after 1946. Then, apparently very famously, the City of Trieste is a free state from 1947 through 1954, giving us the general range of this globe. Then we move to the fact that Germany is not divided up, meaning that this is prior to May 23rd, 1949. To get it even more precise, I went to what I'm good at, which is World History, and found that Siam is still called Siam and not Thailand, meaning that this is prior to June 23rd, 1939. And finally, we can note that this globe notes the state of Israel being created, meaning that this is post May 14th, 1948, placing this globe within the one-year period of May 14th, 1948, and June 23rd, 1939. Shout-out to everyone that corrected me. It was really fun learning from y'all. And if you appreciate this content, please consider following me, because I make a lot of different globe videos. Also, if you have a globe, please send it to me on Instagram. I love doing this.",

    "text": "This old moldy globe that I saw at a thrift store ended up being one of the most interesting globes I have ever dated. I was a ground to see how I did it. Firstly, we know that Anglo-Egyptian Sudan still exists, placing the subtle wide estimate between 1899 and 1956. Then we can see that the Union of South Africa still exists, which includes modern-day Namibia, which means that it's after 1910. Once we've placed it in that area, we have to get really, really specific. So I found out that the Kyrgyz SSR was called the Kyrgyz A-S-S-R prior to 1936, meaning that this map, which has the Kyrgyz SSR, is after 1936. Forgive the mold on this one, but we see that Burma is out of the British rule of India, meaning that this is after 1937. And then we can see that World War II has not started as Germany has not taken Austria or invaded Poland or taken from Czechoslovakia. Meaning that this is prior to 1938. More specifically March 12, 1938, when the Anshulis happened where Austria was merged with Germany. Once we have it in this two-year period, I had to get super, super specific. And I found out that a Russian town, or at the time the USSR town of Orinburg, was renamed Czecholov in December 26, 1938. So I checked to see what the town name on this globe was and it had Czecholov, meaning that this globe had to have been made in after December 26, 1938. So since there is basically no way that we could have just predicted that this name was going to be changed, what must have happened was they made it in early 1939 and they simply did not recognize the Anshulis. Making this map, one of the last accurate globes before World War II.",

So no, we don't sign away our morality when we join a heightened institute of higher learning. Actually, I went specifically so I could do more work and more good. Also, there's not anti-elidism per se. We have an issue with the specific elites for specific reasons because of how specifically they got their money, influence, and power. And we want a world where people have to earn and deserve anything they get and work for. So no, anyone that did join any of these institutions both can and has an obligation to speak up and speak out against the disgusting things happening in Gaza.",

First and foremost, we see that Trinidad and Tobago is independent meaning that this is after 1962 Then on the other side we see that Brunei is not independent So this is prior to 1984 We can narrow it down a little more by seeing that Jibouti modern day is labeled the French territory of a farce and esace Which only existed between 1967 and 1977 Then we see that the United Arab Emirates exists. So this is after 1971 Finally, this is where it got really difficult. We have to see that Cape Verda is independent Which means that it's after July 5th, 1975 And after much digging I noticed that the Central African Republic is not the Central African Empire and it changes the name in December 1976 Which means that this is between July 5th 1975 and December 1976 a lot of globes might not even have the Central African Empire, but either way that is the six-month window this globe is",

So, the time in which Egypt was the only member of the United Arab Republic was between 1961 and 1971. Then we see that French Somali land exists, which dates this prior to 1967. Then we notice that Indonesia has yet to take rest, Iran, which it got from the UN in 1963. Next, we see an independent Jamaica, which got its independence in August 6, 1962, which means that this globe only could have been made within this 10-month period.

    "text": "Someone sent me a globe. Help me data. This is from a really hard time period to do this, but we found some interesting things, so watch and see. In this one area, we see two really helpful things. First of all that Yemen is still split, which means that this map is before 1990, and second of all that the former French territory of a farce, any sauce, is jibbuti, meaning this is sometime after 1977, placing this comfortably in the 70s and 80s. Then we can hop over to the Caribbean and see that Antiga and Barbuda are independent from the United Kingdom, meaning that this is after 1981 November 25th. Next we see that Burkina Fasho is still called the Upper Volta, which means that it's before 1984. From there I almost got stuck, but then I noticed that the Bangladesh city of Dhaka was still spelled with two seas and not a K. And they changed their spelling in 1983, meaning that this is before 1983. And the final one is a bit of a long shot just because this confederation was barely recognized, but the Singambian confederation is not recognized in this map, meaning that it is sometime prior to 1982 February 1st. This time period was really really hard, leading for our last two to kind of be really iffy, but ultimately that places our map between November 25th, 1981 and February 1st, 1982. If you like this, I make a lot of globe videos, um, they're in the playlist, and if you have a globe that you want me to date, please please please, just DM it to me on Instagram. I always love doing this.",

First of all, at the time in which you were speaking when Jordan needs your Pelded, correct the Palestinians and Arabs did not want a state of Gaza and the West Bank. It's at the very least under international law at that time they were entitled to what was under the partition plan. I don't know who know maps queen but that's not just Gaza and the West Bank. Also, Gaza and the West Bank as a state is a silly state because it just wouldn't like trade wise function. You would need at least a corridor between them. But second of all, you referenced the PLO later in this video. The PLO now has accepted what is effectively a state of the Gaza and the West Bank on the pre-1967 borders. If you're going to cite the claims and goals of the PLO in this video, read the PLO's actual position on the two-state solution right now.",

Starting off, we see a split Vietnam between North and South Vietnam. That only happened between 1954 and 1975. Then we can see that Ghana is called Ghana and not the Golden Coast, which would mean that it's after 1957. This one was a little hard to see, but that little sliver of yellow is Malawi, which used to be called Nyosland, but changed its name in 1964. This is the little detail that really gave it away. This has Belize as British Honduras, and Belize got its name of Belize in 1973, meaning this is before that. Finally, this has Sri Lanka as Sri Lanka and not Saigon, meaning that it is after June 1973. That place is this globe between May 1972 and June 1973. If you have any globes, they will need to date DM me. Thanks.",

This first one was really, really interesting, because we see Egypt labeled as the United Arab Republic, which was a republic that was formed by the Union of Syria and Egypt. But Syria left. So, the time in which Egypt was the only member of the United Arab Republic was between 1961 and 1971. Then we see that French Somali land exists, which dates this prior to 1967. Then we notice that Indonesia has yet to take rest, Iran, which it got from the UN in 1963. Next we see an independent Jamaica, which got its independence in August 6, 1962, which means that this globe only could have been made within this ten-month period.

    "text": "Let's talk about the relationship between crime and poverty. Because he is ignoring the material reasons that actually lead to the relationship between crime and poverty and blaming on a cultural problem. When actually it's completely the opposite. Culturally, impoverished people are aware and care about the law a lot more. But materially, they're put in situations where following the law have a lot worse material consequences, right? Not stealing means you can't eat. Not engaging in a gang means you can't live. But culturally, right, the law has a lot more consequences as well. And so like as a person, a white man who grew up in a suburban area, I can tell you the culture of like growing up in a white, super rich suburban area is a lot more laissez-faire with the law. You could talk about a list of substance abuse, right? We could talk about thieves like stealing from retail stores. All of that actually have higher rates of happening and they care way, way less. Why? Because when you grow up rich and white, you're notably less likely to be persecuted for those things. The law has less teeth against you. But when you grow up poor, right, in a poor neighborhood, the law has a lot more teeth. You are overpoliced and you know people who have gone to jail for this reason. You know people that have been fine gone to court for this reason. You have seen the consequences of breaking the law and you're aware of the material consequences of it much more than some white woman that's stealing from Sephora because no one she knows has ever been gone to jail for it. So now the reason poverty leads to crime is because when you're unpoversed, you need to break the law a lot more or there are at least the material consequences of following the law are greater. But the culture actually leads the exact opposite. So when I promote that culture and I say, hey, maybe we shouldn't follow laws that are immoral, hey, maybe we should change laws that are wrong. Hey, maybe it's not the worst thing that people have to break the laws. We shouldn't put a moral case on laws. I'm not promoting a culture that is common in impoverished areas. If anything, I'm promoting the exact culture that I was raised in because the law had basically no teeth for white, rich, suburban areas. Which is true. And bad, I'm not saying it's good, but just talking about reality.",

So this is after 1971 Finally, this is where it got really difficult. We have to see that Cape Verda is independent Which means that it's after July 5th 1975 and after much digging I noticed that the Central African Republic is not the Central African Empire and it changes the name in December 1976 which means that this is between July 5th 1975 and December 1976 a lot of globes might not even have the Central African Empire But either way that is the six-month window this globe is",

And then the next words you say are the social media firestorm when you are talking about a real actual firestorm by the state that you were hired for and still support. I'm beyond trying to debunk what Noah says. I'm now just wanting everyone to see how this propaganda works. If you hear passive tense like that from anyone...",

You bought it. And you are explicitly saying in interviews that you are directly copying other turning 20 becoming an adult not a child star people. Like, our whole critique of you is not that it's like really out there and wild and insane. It's that it's like the most basic version and conception of this in the world. And like, that's not even my critique. My critique is that you've done it like completely flambasting like queer musical history for no reason. So you took your kids from Elvis Presley. Like, your publicist is working really, really hard. But our issue is that anyone can hire a publicist and it's not that difficult. And nothing about this is unique to you. There have been a lot of child stars that have done exactly the same thing as you and you've said as much.",

Not even close because if the British made it decided they didn't want Palestinians in that land anymore, they had every right to go ahead and remove them. Actually, actually, no, they didn't. It's a land that belonged to them. Why not? Because it's a trust territory. In part, this is why I ask you if you know what a trust territory is. What's a trust territory? Where you're hiding it for the interest of somebody else? Yeah, in the simplest possible way. So when they do, you cannot act against the interest, against the beneficial interests of the native peoples.",
